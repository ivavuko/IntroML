After leaving the Federal Reserve, he was appointed a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution. During his tenure as chairman, Bernanke oversaw the Federal Reserve's response to the late-2000s financial crisis, for which he was named the 2009 Time Person of the Year. Before becoming Federal Reserve chairman, Bernanke was a tenured professor at Princeton University and chaired the department of economics there from 1996 to September 2002, when he went on public service leave. Bernanke was awarded the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Douglas Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig, ""for research on banks and financial crises"", more specifically for his analysis of the Great Depression.
From August 5, 2002, until June 21, 2005, he was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, proposed the Bernanke doctrine, and first discussed ""the Great Moderation""—the theory that traditional business cycles have declined in volatility in recent decades through structural changes that have occurred in the international economy, particularly increases in the economic stability of developing nations, diminishing the influence of macroeconomic (monetary and fiscal) policy.
Bernanke then served as chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers before President Bush nominated him to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the United States Federal Reserve. His first term began February 1, 2006. Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being renominated by President Barack Obama, who later referred to him as ""the epitome of calm."" His second term ended January 31, 2014, when he was succeeded by Janet Yellen on February 3, 2014.Bernanke wrote about his time as chairman of the Federal Reserve in his 2015 book, The Courage to Act, in which he revealed that the world's economy came close to collapse in 2007 and 2008.

In the mid-1970s, Alter and his research team demonstrated that most post-transfusion hepatitis cases were not due to hepatitis A or hepatitis B viruses. Working independently, Alter and Edward Tabor, a scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, proved through transmission studies in chimpanzees that a new form of hepatitis, initially called ""non-A, non-B hepatitis"" caused the infections, and that the causative agent was probably a virus. This work eventually led to the discovery of the hepatitis C virus in 1988, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2020 along with Michael Houghton and Charles M.

She attended Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University but did not obtain a degree. In addition to being an author, she has taught poetry at several academic institutions.
Glück is often described as an autobiographical poet; her work is known for its emotional intensity and for frequently drawing on mythology or nature imagery to meditate on personal experiences and modern life. Thematically, her poems have illuminated aspects of trauma, desire, and nature. In doing so, they have become known for frank expressions of sadness and isolation. Scholars have also focused on her construction of poetic personas and the relationship, in her poems, between autobiography and classical myth.
Glück serves as the Frederick Iseman Professor in the Practice of Poetry at Yale University and as a professor of English at Stanford University.

He is co-laureate of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Jim Peebles and Didier Queloz, and the winner of the 2010 Viktor Ambartsumian International Prize and the 2015 Kyoto Prize.
Together with Didier Queloz in 1995, he discovered 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet orbiting a sun-like star, 51 Pegasi. For this achievement, they were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics ""for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star"" resulting in ""contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth’s place in the cosmos"".
Related to the discovery, Mayor noted that humans will never migrate to such exoplanets since they are ""much, much too far away ... [and would take] hundreds of millions of days using the means we have available today"".

He was a professor of Mechanical, Materials Science, and Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. He is widely credited with the identification and development of the lithium-ion battery, for developing the Goodenough–Kanamori rules in determining the sign of the magnetic superexchange in materials, and for seminal developments in computer random-access memory.
Goodenough was born in Jena, German Reich (Weimar Republic), to American parents. During and after graduating from Yale University, Goodenough served as a U.S. military meteorologist in World War II. He went on to obtain his Ph.D. in physics at the University of Chicago, became a researcher at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and later the head of the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Oxford. From 1986 on he was a professor in the school of engineering at UT Austin.
Goodenough was awarded the National Medal of Science, the Copley Medal, the Fermi Award, the Draper Prize, and the Japan Prize. The John B. Goodenough Award in materials science is named for him. In 2019, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry alongside M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino, and, at 97 years old, became the oldest Nobel laureate in history.

Handke is considered to be one of the most influential and original German-language writers in the second half of the 20th century.In the late 1960s, he earned his reputation as a member of the avant-garde with such plays as Offending the Audience (1966) in which actors analyze the nature of theatre and alternately insult the audience and praise its ""performance"", and Kaspar (1967). His novels, mostly ultraobjective, deadpan accounts of characters in extreme states of mind, include The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick (1970) and The Left-Handed Woman (1976). Prompted by his mother's suicide in 1971, he reflected her life in the novella A Sorrow Beyond Dreams (1972). A dominant theme of his works is the deadening effects and underlying irrationality of ordinary language, everyday reality, and rational order. Handke was a member of the Grazer Gruppe (an association of authors) and the Grazer Autorenversammlung, and co-founded the Verlag der Autoren publishing house in Frankfurt. He collaborated with director Wim Wenders,  leading to screenplays such as The Wrong Move and Wings of Desire.
In 1973, he won the Georg Büchner Prize, the most important literary prize for German-language literature, but in 1999, as a sign of protest against the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Handke returned the prize money to the German Academy for Language and Literature.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Handke,78,"['1942 births', '20th-century Austrian dramatists and playwrights', '20th-century Austrian male writers', '20th-century Austrian novelists', '20th-century Austrian poets', '21st-century Austrian dramatists and playwrights', '21st-century Austrian male writers', '21st-century Austrian novelists', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Anton Wildgans Prize winners', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with BNMM identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with German-language sources (de)', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with ULAN identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from December 2019', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2023', 'Austrian Nobel laureates', 'Austrian male dramatists and playwrights', 'Austrian male poets', 'Austrian people of German descent', 'Austrian people of Slovenian descent', 'CS1 Croatian-language sources (hr)', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'CS1 Serbian-language sources (sr)', 'CS1 Serbo-Croatian-language sources (sh)', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 maint', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Deniers of the Bosnian genocide', 'Eastern Orthodox Christians from Austria', 'Eastern Orthodox writers', 'Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts', 'Georg Büchner Prize winners', 'German-language poets', 'Living people', 'Members of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the Republika Srpska', 'Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts', 'Members of the Serbian Orthodox Church', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People from Völkermarkt District', 'People of Carinthian Slovene descent', 'Peter Handke', 'Schiller Memorial Prize winners', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Use dmy dates from September 2020', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Yugoslav people of German descent']",81,329

For her novel Flights, Tokarczuk has been awarded the 2018 Man Booker International Prize (translated by Jennifer Croft). Her works include Primeval and Other Times, Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead, and The Books of Jacob.
Tokarczuk is noted for the mythical tone of her writing. A clinical psychologist from the University of Warsaw, she has published a collection of poems, several novels, as well as other books with shorter prose works. For Flights and The Books of Jacob, she won the Nike Awards, Poland's top literary prize, among other accolades; she also won five times Nike audience award. In 2015, she received the German-Polish Bridge Prize for contribution in mutual understanding between European nations. Tokarczuk faced some backlash from nationalist groups in her homeland after the publication of The Books of Jacob, which is set in 18th-century Poland, because the novel celebrates the country’s cultural diversity.
Her works have been translated into almost 40 languages, making her one of the most translated contemporary Polish writers. The Books of Jacob, regarded as her magnum opus, was released in the UK in November 2021 after seven years of translation work, followed by release in the US in February 2022.

85,Bob Dylan,The Nobel Prize in Literature,2016,1941,USA,, 1/1 ,, “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition” ,,,,,"Bob Dylan (legally Robert Dylan, born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. Generally regarded as one of the greatest songwriters ever, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture over his 60 year career. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as ""Blowin' in the Wind"" (1963) and ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.Dylan was born and raised in St. Louis County, Minnesota. Following his self-titled debut album of traditional folk songs in 1962, he made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan the next year. The album features ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and the thematically complex ""A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"". Many of his songs adapted the tunes and phrasing of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy among folk purists when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited (both 1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966). His six-minute single ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.In July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were later released as the collaborative album The Basement Tapes in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in John Wesley Harding (1967), Nashville Skyline (1969), and New Morning (1970). In 1975, he released Blood on the Tracks, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's 1997 album Time Out of Mind marked the beginning of a renaissance for his career. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since then, the most recent being Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020). He also recorded a series of three albums of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by Frank Sinatra, and an album smoothing his early rock material into a mellower Americana sensibility, Shadow Kingdom (2023). Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the Never Ending Tour.Since 1994, Dylan has published nine books of paintings and drawings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 145 million records, making him one of the best-selling musicians ever. He has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize Board in 2008 awarded him a special citation for ""his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power"".

86,Juan Manuel Santos,The Nobel Peace Prize,2016,1951,Colombia,, 1/1 ,, “for his resolute efforts to bring the country's more than 50-year-long civil war to an end” ,,,,,"Juan Manuel Santos Calderón  (Spanish: [ˈxwan maˈnwel ˈsantos kaldeˈɾon]; born 10 August 1951) is a Colombian politician who was the President of Colombia from 2010 to 2018. He was the sole recipient of the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize.
An economist by profession and a journalist by trade, Santos is a member of the wealthy and influential Santos family, who from 1913 to 2007 were the majority shareholders of El Tiempo, Colombia's newspaper of record.
In 1991, he was appointed by President César Gaviria Trujillo as Colombia's first Minister of Foreign Trade. In 2000, he was appointed by President Andrés Pastrana Arango as the 64th Minister of Finance and Public Credit.Santos rose to prominence during the administration of President Álvaro Uribe Vélez, who was elected in 2002. In 2005, Santos co-founded and led the Social Party of National Unity (Party of the U), a liberal-conservative party coalition that backed the policies of President Uribe, successfully supporting his attempt to seek a constitutional reform to be able to run for a second term. In 2006, after Uribe's re-election, when the Party of the U won a majority of seats in the two chambers of Congress, Santos was appointed as Minister of National Defence, and continued defending the security policies of President Uribe, taking a strong and forceful stance against FARC and the other guerrilla groups operating in Colombia. His time at the Ministry of Defense was tarnished by the ""False positives"" scandal, the executions of thousands of civilians that the army passed off as guerrillas killed in combat.
In 2010, Santos won the presidential election as the protégé of Uribe. Some months later, Uribe became his strongest opponent, and also founded three years later the opposition party Democratic Center. This rivalry determined both Santos' unpopularity and his near-missed defeat during the 2014 Colombian presidential election against  Uribe's protégé Óscar Iván Zuluaga.On 7 October 2016, Santos was announced as recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts negotiating a peace treaty with the FARC-guerrilla in the country, despite his defeat in the referendum held over the deal, where the ""No"" campaign led by Uribe's Democratic Center won narrowly. The Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised peace deal on 24 November and sent it to Congress for ratification instead of conducting a second referendum. Both houses of Congress ratified the revised peace accord on 29–30 November 2016, marking an end to the conflict. The treaty brought deep divisions and polarization in the country, which questions its legitimacy. Santos has been named as one of Time's 100 most influential people. Santos left office with one of the lowest levels of popular approval ever, and his successor was Uribe's new protégé, Iván Duque, a moderate critic of Santos' peace treaty with the FARC guerilla.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_Santos,88,"['1951 births', 'Academic staff of the University of Los Andes (Colombia)', 'All BLP articles lacking sources', 'Alumni of the London School of Economics', 'Articles needing more viewpoints from October 2016', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'BLP articles lacking sources from October 2016', 'CS1 European Spanish-language sources (es-es)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 errors', 'Collars of the Order of Isabella the Catholic', 'Colombian Liberal Party politicians', 'Colombian Ministers of Defense', 'Colombian Nobel laureates', 'Colombian economists', 'Commons link from Wikidata', 'Fulbright alumni', 'Harvard Kennedy School alumni', 'Honorary Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath', 'Juan Manuel Santos', 'Living people', 'Members of the Inter-American Dialogue', 'Ministers of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia', 'Ministers of Foreign Trade of Colombia', 'Nieman Fellows', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Pages using Template', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People named in the Paradise Papers', 'Politicians from Bogotá', 'Presidential Designates of Colombia', 'Presidents of Colombia', 'Santos family', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Social Party of National Unity politicians', 'The Fletcher School at Tufts University alumni', 'University of Kansas alumni', 'Use dmy dates from October 2020']",50,345

Modiano's works have been translated into more than 30 languages and have been celebrated in and around France, but most of his novels had not been translated into English before he was awarded the Nobel Prize.Modiano previously won the 2012 Austrian State Prize for European Literature, the 2010 Prix mondial Cino Del Duca from the Institut de France for lifetime achievement, the 1978 Prix Goncourt for Rue des boutiques obscures, and the 1972 Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française for Les Boulevards de ceinture.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Modiano,90,"['1945 births', '20th-century French novelists', '21st-century French novelists', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from July 2023', 'Commandeurs of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres', 'French Nobel laureates', 'French male novelists', 'French people of Flemish descent', 'French people of Greek-Jewish descent', 'French people of Italian-Jewish descent', ""Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française winners"", 'Living people', 'Lycée Henri-IV alumni', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Officers of the Legion of Honour', 'Prix Fénéon winners', 'Prix Goncourt winners', 'Prix des libraires winners', 'Roger Nimier Prize winners', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Writers from Boulogne-Billancourt']",55,69
110,Kailash Satyarthi,The Nobel Peace Prize,2014,1954,India,, 1/2 ,, “for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education” ,,,,,"Kailash Satyarthi (born 11 January 1954) is an Indian social reformer who campaigned against child labor in India and advocated the universal right to education. In 2014, he was the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Malala Yousafzai, ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education."" He is the founder of multiple social activist organizations, including Bachpan Bachao Andolan, Global March Against Child Labour, Global Campaign for Education, Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, and Bal Ashram Trust.
Kailash Satyarthi and his team at Bachpan Bachao Andolan have liberated more than 86,000 children in India from child labour, slavery and trafficking. In 1998, Satyarthi conceived and led the Global March against Child Labour, an 80,000 km (ca. 49,710 mi)-long march across 103 countries to put forth a global demand against worst forms of child labour. This became one of the largest social movements ever on behalf of exploited children. The demands of the marchers, which included children and youth (particularly the survivors of trafficking for forced labor, exploitation, sexual abuse, illegal organ transplants, armed conflict, etc.) were reflected in the draft of the ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The following year, the Convention was unanimously adopted at the ILO Conference in Geneva.
He has served on the board and committee of several international organizations including the Center for Victims of Torture (USA), the International Labor Rights Fund (USA), and the Cocoa Initiative. Satyarthi was among Fortune magazine's ""World's Greatest Leaders"" in 2015 and featured in LinkedIn's Power Profiles List in 2017 and 2018. Satyarthi led a nationwide march, Bharat Yatra, in India covering 19,000 km (12,000 mi) in 35 days, to demand for legislation against child rape and child sexual abuse.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kailash_Satyarthi,69,"['1954 births', '20th-century Indian educational theorists', '20th-century Indian engineers', '21st-century Indian educational theorists', 'Activists from Madhya Pradesh', 'All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English', 'All articles with a promotional tone', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with a promotional tone from January 2023', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Ashoka India Fellows', 'Ashoka USA Fellows', 'Barkatullah University alumni', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Debt bondage in South Asia', 'Engineers from Madhya Pradesh', 'Indian Nobel laureates', ""Indian children's rights activists"", 'Indian electrical engineers', 'Living people', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People from Vidisha', 'Robert F.

111,Malala Yousafzai,The Nobel Peace Prize,2014,1997,Pakistan,, 1/2 ,, “for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education” ,,,,,"Malala Yousafzai (Urdu: ملالہ یوسفزئی, Pashto: ملاله یوسفزۍ, pronunciation: [məˈlaːlə jusəf ˈzəj]; born 12 July 1997) is a Pakistani female education activist and the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize laureate at the age of 17. She is the world's youngest Nobel Prize laureate, the second Pakistani and the first Pashtun to receive a Nobel Prize. Yousafzai is a human rights advocate for the education of women and children in her native homeland, Swat, where the Pakistani Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Her advocacy has grown into an international movement, and according to former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she has become Pakistan's ""most prominent citizen.""The daughter of education activist Ziauddin Yousafzai, she was born to a Yusufzai Pashtun family in Swat and was named after the Afghan folk heroine Malalai of Maiwand. Considering Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Barack Obama, and Benazir Bhutto as her role models, she was also inspired by her father's thoughts and humanitarian work. In early 2009, when she was 11, she wrote a blog under her pseudonym Gul Makai for the BBC Urdu to detail her life during the Taliban's occupation of Swat. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her life as the Pakistan Armed Forces launched Operation Rah-e-Rast against the militants in Swat. She rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu.
On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in Swat District after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a Taliban gunman in an assassination attempt targeting her for her activism; the gunman fled the scene. She was struck in the head by a bullet and remained unconscious and in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, but her condition later improved enough for her to be transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK. The attempt on her life sparked an international outpouring of support. Deutsche Welle reported in January 2013 that she may have become ""the most famous teenager in the world"". Weeks after the attempted murder, a group of 50 leading Muslim clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwā against those who tried to kill her. The Pakistani Taliban were internationally denounced by governments, human rights organizations and feminist groups. They responded to condemnation by further denouncing Yousafzai, indicating plans for a possible second assassination attempt which they felt was justified as a religious obligation. This sparked another international outcry.After her recovery, Yousafzai became a prominent activist for the right to education. Based in Birmingham, she co-founded the Malala Fund, a non-profit organisation, with Shiza Shahid. In 2013, she co-authored I Am Malala, an international best seller. In 2012, she received Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize and the 2013 Sakharov Prize. In 2014, she was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, with Kailash Satyarthi of India. Aged 17 at the time, she was the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate. In 2015, she was the subject of the Oscar-shortlisted documentary He Named Me Malala. The 2013, 2014 and 2015 issues of Time magazine featured her as one of the most influential people globally. In 2017 she was awarded honorary Canadian citizenship and became the youngest person to address the House of Commons of Canada.Yousafzai completed her secondary school education at Edgbaston High School, Birmingham in England from 2013 to 2017. From there she won a place at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, and undertook three years of study for a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE), graduating in 2020.

This so-called Higgs mechanism, which was proposed by several physicists besides Higgs at about the same time, predicts the existence of a new particle, the Higgs boson, the detection of which became one of the great goals of physics. On 4 July 2012, CERN announced the discovery of the boson at the Large Hadron Collider. The Higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important ingredient in the Standard Model of particle physics, without which certain particles would have no mass.Higgs has been honoured with a number of awards in recognition of his work, including the 1981 Hughes Medal from the Royal Society; the 1984 Rutherford Medal from the Institute of Physics; the 1997 Dirac Medal and Prize for outstanding contributions to theoretical physics from the Institute of Physics; the 1997 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize by the European Physical Society; the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics; the 2009 Oskar Klein Memorial Lecture medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; the 2010 American Physical Society J.

She completed her education in the United States, where she studied at Madison Business College, the University of Colorado Boulder, and Harvard University. She returned to Liberia to work in William Tolbert's government as Deputy Minister of Finance from 1971 to 1974. Later, she worked again in the West, for the World Bank in the Caribbean and Latin America. In 1979, she received a cabinet appointment as Minister of Finance, serving to 1980.
After Samuel Doe seized power in 1980 in a coup d'état and executed Tolbert, Sirleaf fled to the United States. She worked for Citibank and then the Equator Bank. She returned to Liberia to contest a senatorial seat for Montserrado County in 1985, an election that was disputed.

155,Mario Vargas Llosa,The Nobel Prize in Literature,2010,1936,Peru,, 1/1 ,," “for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat” ",,,,,"Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa, 1st Marquess of Vargas Llosa (born 28 March 1936), more commonly known as Mario Vargas Llosa (, Spanish: [ˈmaɾjo ˈβaɾɣas ˈʎosa]), is a Peruvian novelist, journalist, essayist and former politician, who also holds citizenship of Spain and the Dominican Republic. Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists and one of the leading writers of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom. In 2010, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature, ""for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat."" He also won the 1967 Rómulo Gallegos Prize, the 1986 Prince of Asturias Award, the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1995 Jerusalem Prize, the 2012 Carlos Fuentes International Prize, and the 2018 Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit. In 2021, he was elected to the Académie française.Vargas Llosa rose to international fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, literally The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and the monumental Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral, 1969/1975). He writes, prolifically, across an array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.
Many of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. Another change, over the course of his career, has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism to a sometimes playful postmodernism.
Like many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro, Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with its policies, particularly after the imprisonment of Cuban poet Heberto Padilla in 1971, and now, he identifies as a liberal and holds anti-left wing ideas.

He was arrested numerous times, and was described as China's most prominent dissident and the country's most famous political prisoner. On 26 June 2017, he was granted medical parole after being diagnosed with liver cancer; he died a few weeks later on 13 July 2017.Liu rose to fame in 1980s Chinese literary circles with his exemplary literary critiques. He eventually became a visiting scholar at several international universities. He returned to China to support the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was imprisoned for the first time from 1989 to 1991, again from 1995 to 1996 and yet again from 1996 to 1999 for his involvement on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power. He served as the President of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, from 2003 to 2007. He was also the president of Minzhu Zhongguo (Democratic China) magazine starting in the mid-1990s. On 8 December 2008, Liu was detained due to his participation with the Charter 08 manifesto. He was formally arrested on 23 June 2009 on suspicion of ""inciting subversion of state power"". He was tried on the same charges on 23 December 2009 and sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment and two years' deprivation of political rights on 25 December 2009.During his fourth prison term, Liu was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for ""his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.""Liu was the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China. He was the third person to have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize while in prison or detention, after Germany's Carl von Ossietzky (1935) and Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi (1991). He was the second person to have been denied the right to have a representative collect the Nobel Prize for him as well as the second to die in custody, with the first being Ossietzky, who died in Westend hospital in Berlin-Charlottenburg after being detained in a Nazi concentration camp.

Since the early 1990s, she has been internationally established, and her works have been translated into more than twenty languages.Müller is noted for her works depicting the effects of violence, cruelty and terror, usually in the setting of the Socialist Republic of Romania under the repressive Nicolae Ceaușescu regime which she has experienced herself. Many of her works are told from the viewpoint of the German minority in Romania and are also a depiction of the modern history of the Germans in the Banat and Transylvania. Her much acclaimed 2009 novel The Hunger Angel (Atemschaukel) portrays the deportation of Romania's German minority to Soviet Gulags during the Soviet occupation of Romania for use as German forced labor.
Müller has received more than twenty awards to date, including the Kleist Prize (1994), the Aristeion Prize (1995), the International Dublin Literary Award (1998) and the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award (2009).

170,Barack Hussein Obama,The Nobel Peace Prize,2009,1961,USA,, 1/1 ,, “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples” ,,,,,"Barack Hussein Obama II ( (listen) bə-RAHK hoo-SAYN oh-BAH-mə; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American  president. Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004, and worked as a civil rights lawyer and university lecturer. 
Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Joe Biden as his running mate. Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism.
Obama's first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis and included a major stimulus package, a partial extension of George W. Bush's tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major U.S. military presence in Iraq. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He ordered the counterterrorism raid which killed Osama bin Laden and downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. Obama also ordered military involvement in Libya in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.
After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. In his second term, Obama took steps to combat climate change, signing a major international climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout Obama's presidency. Obama promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans, culminating in the Supreme Court's decision to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges.
During Obama's terms as president, the United States' reputation abroad, as well as the American economy, significantly improved. Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C. His presidential library in Chicago began construction in 2021. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in various American elections. Outside of politics, Obama has published three bestselling books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006) and A Promised Land (2020). Rankings by scholars and historians, in which he has been featured since 2010, place him in the middle to upper tier of American presidents.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama,241,"['1961

Ertl's research laid the foundation of modern surface chemistry, which has helped explain how fuel cells produce energy without pollution, how catalytic converters clean up car exhausts and even why iron rusts, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.
His work has paved the way for development of cleaner energy sources and will guide the development of fuel cells, said Astrid Graslund, secretary of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
He was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his studies of chemical processes on solid surfaces. The Nobel academy said Ertl provided a detailed description of how chemical reactions take place on surfaces. His findings applied in both academic studies and industrial development, the academy said. “Surface chemistry can even explain the destruction of the ozone layer, as vital steps in the reaction actually take place on the surfaces of small crystals of ice in the stratosphere,” the award citation reads.
In 2015, Ertl signed the Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting.

Gore was the Democratic nominee for president of the United States in the 2000 presidential election. He lost the electoral college vote 266–271 to Republican nominee George W. Bush, despite winning the popular vote by approximately 543,895 votes. The election concluded after the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 5–4 in Bush v. Gore against a previous ruling by the Supreme Court of Florida on a re-count that would have likely given Gore a razor-thin lead in the state of Florida, had the re-count continued as planned. Gore is one of only five presidential candidates in American history to lose a presidential election despite winning the popular vote.
The son of politician Albert Gore Sr., Gore was an elected official for 24 years. He was a U.S. representative from Tennessee (1977–1985) and from 1985 to 1993 served as a U.S. senator from that state. He served as vice president during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001, defeating incumbents George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle in 1992, and Bob Dole and Jack Kemp in 1996. As of 2023, Gore's 1990 re-election remains the last time Democrats won a Senate election in Tennessee.
After his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and environmental activist, whose work in climate change activism earned him (jointly with the IPCC) the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. Gore is the founder and current chair of The Climate Reality Project, the co-founder and chair of Generation Investment Management, the now-defunct Current TV network, a member of the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. and a senior adviser to Google. Gore is also a partner in the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, heading its climate change solutions group. He has served as a visiting professor at Middle Tennessee State University, Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Fisk University and the University of California, Los Angeles. He served on the Board of Directors of World Resources Institute.Gore has received a number of awards that include the Nobel Peace Prize (joint award with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007), a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album (2009) for his book An Inconvenient Truth, a Primetime Emmy Award for Current TV (2007), and a Webby Award (2005). Gore was also the subject of the Academy Award winning (2007) documentary An Inconvenient Truth in 2006, as well as its 2017 sequel An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. In 2007, he was named a runner-up for Time's 2007 Person of the Year.

Hurwicz shared the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (with Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson) for his seminal work on mechanism design. Hurwicz was one of the oldest Nobel Laureates, having received the prize at the age of 90.
Hurwicz was educated and grew up in Poland, and became a refugee in the United States after Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. In 1941, Hurwicz worked as a research assistant for Paul Samuelson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Oskar Lange at the University of Chicago. He was a research associate for the Cowles Commission between 1942 and 1946. In 1946 he became an associate professor of economics at Iowa State College.

Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ""for their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below"". The Norwegian Nobel Committee said that ""lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty"" and that ""across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development"". Yunus has received several other national and international honours. He received the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.In February 2011, Yunus together with Saskia Bruysten, Sophie Eisenmann and Hans Reitz co-founded Yunus Social Business – Global Initiatives (YSB). YSB creates and empowers social businesses to address and solve social problems around the world. As the international implementation arm for Yunus' vision of a new, humane capitalism, YSB manages incubator funds for social businesses in developing countries and provides advisory services to companies, governments, foundations and NGOs.
In 2012, he became Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, a position he held until 2018. Previously, he was a professor of economics at Chittagong University in Bangladesh.

Early in his career, he became known for his research at Yale's Cowles Foundation in the first half of the 1960s on the sources of economic growth. His demonstration of the golden rule savings rate, a concept related to work by John von Neumann, started a wave of research on how much a nation should spend on present consumption rather than save and invest for future generations.
Phelps was at the University of Pennsylvania from 1966 to 1971 and moved to Columbia University in 1971. His most seminal work inserted a microfoundation, one featuring imperfect information, incomplete knowledge and expectations about wages and prices, to support a macroeconomic theory of employment determination and price-wage dynamics. That led to his development of the natural rate of unemployment: its existence and the mechanism governing its size. In the early 2000s, he turned to the study of business innovation.
He is the founding director, since 2001, of Columbia's Center on Capitalism and Society. He was McVickar Professor of Political Economy at Columbia from 1982 to 2021.

A Nobel Prize winner, Pinter was one of the most influential modern British dramatists with a writing career that spanned more than 50 years. His best-known plays include The Birthday Party (1957), The Homecoming (1964) and Betrayal (1978), each of which he adapted for the screen. His screenplay adaptations of others' works include The Servant (1963), The Go-Between (1971), The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981), The Trial (1993) and Sleuth (2007). He also directed or acted in radio, stage, television and film productions of his own and others' works.
Pinter was born and raised in Hackney, east London, and educated at Hackney Downs School. He was a sprinter and a keen cricket player, acting in school plays and writing poetry. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but did not complete the course. He was fined for refusing national service as a conscientious objector. Subsequently, he continued training at the Central School of Speech and Drama and worked in repertory theatre in Ireland and England. In 1956 he married actress Vivien Merchant and had a son, Daniel, born in 1958. He left Merchant in 1975 and married author Lady Antonia Fraser in 1980.
Pinter's career as a playwright began with a production of The Room in 1957. His second play, The Birthday Party, closed after eight performances but was enthusiastically reviewed by critic Harold Hobson. His early works were described by critics as ""comedy of menace"". Later plays such as No Man's Land (1975) and Betrayal (1978) became known as ""memory plays"". He appeared as an actor in productions of his own work on radio and film, and directed nearly 50 productions for stage, theatre and screen. Pinter received over 50 awards, prizes and other honours, including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005 and the French Légion d'honneur in 2007.
Despite frail health after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in December 2001, Pinter continued to act on stage and screen, last performing the title role of Samuel Beckett's one-act monologue Krapp's Last Tape, for the 50th anniversary season of the Royal Court Theatre, in October 2006.

It was established in 1957 as an autonomous organization within the United Nations system; though governed by its own founding treaty, the organization reports to both the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations, and is headquartered at the UN Office at Vienna, Austria.
The IAEA was created in response to growing international concern toward nuclear weapons, especially amid rising tensions between the foremost nuclear powers, the United States and the Soviet Union. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's ""Atoms for Peace"" speech, which called for the creation of an international organization to monitor the global proliferation of nuclear resources and technology, is credited with catalyzing the formation of the IAEA, whose treaty came into force on 29 July 1957 upon U.S. ratification.
The IAEA serves as an intergovernmental forum for scientific and technical cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear technology and nuclear power worldwide. It maintains several programs that encourage the development of peaceful applications of nuclear energy, science, and technology; provide international safeguards against misuse of nuclear technology and nuclear materials; and promote and implement nuclear safety (including radiation protection) and nuclear security standards. The organization also conducts research in nuclear science and provides technical support and training in nuclear technology to countries worldwide, particularly in the developing world.Following the ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1968, all non-nuclear powers are required to negotiate a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which is given the authority to monitor nuclear programs and to inspect nuclear facilities.

Fenn shared half of the award with Koichi Tanaka for their work in mass spectrometry. The other half of the 2002 award went to Kurt Wüthrich. Fenn's contributions specifically related to the development of electrospray ionization, now a commonly used technique for large molecules and routine liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Early in his career, Fenn did research in the field of jet propulsion at Project SQUID, and focused on molecular beam studies. Fenn finished his career with more than 100 publications, including one book.
Fenn was born in New York City, and moved to Kentucky with his family during the Great Depression. Fenn did his undergraduate work at Berea College, and received his PhD from Yale. He worked in industry at Monsanto and at private research labs before moving to academic posts including Yale and Virginia Commonwealth University.Fenn's research into electrospray ionization found him at the center of a legal dispute with Yale University.  He lost the lawsuit, after it was determined that he misled the university about the potential usefulness of the technology.  Yale was awarded $500,000 in legal fees and $545,000 in damages.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975, and as a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967.
Carter was born and raised in Plains, Georgia, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946 and joined the U.S. Navy's submarine service. Afterward he returned home, where he revived his family's peanut-growing business. He then manifested his opposition to racial segregation, supported the growing civil rights movement, and became an activist within the Democratic Party. He served in the Georgia State Senate from 1963 to 1967 and then as governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. As a dark-horse candidate not well known outside of Georgia, Carter won the Democratic nomination and narrowly defeated incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford in the 1976 U.S. presidential election.
Carter pardoned all Vietnam War draft evaders. He created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. He successfully pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, and the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. He also confronted stagflation. His administration established the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Education. The end of his presidency was marked by the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island accident, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the Cold War by ending détente, imposing a grain embargo against the Soviets, enunciating the Carter Doctrine, and leading the multinational boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He lost the 1980 presidential election in a landslide to Republican nominee Ronald Reagan.
After leaving the presidency, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. He traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections and further the eradication of infectious diseases. He is a key figure in the nonprofit housing organization Habitat for Humanity and wrote numerous books, ranging from political memoirs to poetry, while continuing to comment on global affairs, including two books on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in which he criticizes Israel's treatment of Palestinians as apartheid. Polls of historians and political scientists generally rank Carter as a slightly below average president, although his post-presidential activities are considered exceptional.

Smith). His empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory.
With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common human errors that arise from heuristics and biases, and developed prospect theory.
In 2011 he was named by Foreign Policy magazine in its list of top global thinkers. In the same year his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller.

Annan and the UN were the co-recipients of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize. He was the founder and chairman of the Kofi Annan Foundation, as well as chairman of The Elders, an international organisation founded by Nelson Mandela.Annan studied economics at Macalester College, international relations at the Graduate Institute Geneva, and management at MIT. Annan joined the UN in 1962, working for the World Health Organization's Geneva office. He went on to work in several capacities at the UN Headquarters, including serving as the Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping between March 1992 and December 1996. He was appointed secretary-general on 13 December 1996 by the Security Council and later confirmed by the General Assembly, making him the first officeholder to be elected from the UN staff itself. He was re-elected for a second term in 2001 and was succeeded as secretary-general by Ban Ki-moon in 2007.
As secretary-general, Annan reformed the UN bureaucracy, worked to combat HIV/AIDS (especially in Africa) and launched the UN Global Compact. He was criticised for not expanding the Security Council and faced calls for his resignation after an investigation into the Oil-for-Food Programme, but was largely exonerated of personal corruption. After the end of his term as secretary-general, he founded the Kofi Annan Foundation in 2007 to work on international development. In 2012, Annan was the UN–Arab League Joint Special Representative for Syria to help find a resolution to the ongoing conflict there.

He is a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2001) and the John Bates Clark Medal (1979). He is a former senior vice president and chief economist of the World Bank. He is also a former member and chairman of the (US president's) Council of Economic Advisers. He is known for his support for the Georgist public finance theory and for his critical view of the management of globalization, of laissez-faire economists (whom he calls ""free-market fundamentalists""), and of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
In 2000, Stiglitz founded the Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD), a think tank on international development based at Columbia University. He has been a member of the Columbia faculty since 2001, and received the university's highest academic rank (university professor) in 2003. He was the founding chair of the university's Committee on Global Thought. He also chairs the University of Manchester's Brooks World Poverty Institute. He was a member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.  In 2009, the President of the United Nations General Assembly Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, appointed Stiglitz as the chairman of the U.N. Commission on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System, where he oversaw suggested proposals and commissioned a report on reforming the international monetary and financial system. He served as the chair of the international Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, appointed by the French President Sarkozy, which issued its report in 2010, Mismeasuring our Lives: Why GDP doesn't add up,  and currently serves as co-chair of its successor, the High Level Expert Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. From 2011 to 2014, Stiglitz was the president of the International Economic Association (IEA). He presided over the organization of the IEA triennial world congress held near the Dead Sea in Jordan in June 2014.Stiglitz has received more than 40 honorary degrees, including degrees from Cambridge and Harvard, and he has been decorated by several governments including Bolivia, South Korea, Colombia, Ecuador, and most recently France, where he was appointed as a member of the Legion of Honor, Officer.
In 2011, Stiglitz was named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by the Time magazine. Stiglitz's work focuses on income distribution from a Georgist perspective, asset risk management, corporate governance, and international trade. He is the author of several books, the latest being People, Power, and Profits (2019),  The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe (2016), The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them (2015), Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy: An Agenda for Growth and Shared Prosperity (2015), and Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth Development and Social Progress (2014).

He is also a noted translator (particularly of Samuel Beckett and Eugène Ionesco), screenwriter, stage director, and a celebrated painter.
Gao's drama is considered to be fundamentally absurdist in nature and avant-garde in his native China. Absolute Signal (1982) was a breakthrough in Chinese experimental theatre. The Bus Stop (1983) and The Other Shore (1986) had their productions halted by the Chinese government, with the acclaimed Wild Man (1985) the last work of his to be publicly performed in China. He left the country in 1987 and his plays from The Other Shore onward increasingly centered on universal (rather than Chinese) concerns, but his 1989 play Exile angered both the government for its depiction of China and the overseas democracy movement for its depiction of intellectuals. In 1998, he was granted French citizenship.
Gao's influences include classical Chinese opera, folk culture, and 20th century European drama such as Antonin Artaud, and he said in 1987 that as a writer he could be placed at the meeting point between Western and Eastern cultures. He is a very private person, however, and later claimed, ""No matter whether it is in politics or literature, I do not believe in or belong to any party or school, and this includes nationalism and patriotism.""

As a teenager, he served as a drafted soldier from late 1944 in the Waffen-SS and was taken as a prisoner of war by US forces at the end of the war in May 1945. He was released in April 1946. Trained as a stonemason and sculptor, Grass began writing in the 1950s. In his fiction, he frequently returned to the Danzig of his childhood.
Grass is best known for his first novel, The Tin Drum (1959), a key text in European magic realism. It was the first book of his Danzig Trilogy, the other two being Cat and Mouse and Dog Years.

He was also Member of Parliament (MP) for Upper Bann from 1990 to 2005 and Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Upper Bann from 1998 to 2007.
Trimble began his career teaching law at The Queen's University of Belfast in the 1970s, during which time he began to get involved with the paramilitary-linked Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party (VPUP). He was elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975, and joined the UUP in 1978 after the VPUP disbanded. Remaining at Queen's University, he continued his academic career until being elected as the MP for Upper Bann in 1990. In 1995 he was unexpectedly elected as the leader of the UUP. He was instrumental in the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and (along with John Hume) won the Nobel Peace Prize that year for his efforts. He was later elected to become the first First Minister of Northern Ireland, although his tenure was turbulent and frequently interrupted by disagreements over the timetable for Provisional Irish Republican Army decommissioning.
Trimble resigned the leadership of the UUP soon after being defeated at the 2005 general election. In June 2006, he accepted a life peerage in the House of Lords, taking the title of Baron Trimble, of Lisnagarvey in the County of Antrim. He did not stand again for the Assembly, which finally reconvened in 2007, instead leaving the UUP to join the Conservative Party.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Trimble,57,"['1944 births', '2022 deaths', ""Academics of Queen's University Belfast"", ""Alumni of Queen's University Belfast"", 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with UKPARL identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Barristers from Northern Ireland', 'British Nobel laureates', 'British legal scholars', 'British political commentators', 'British political writers', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1', 'Conservative Party (UK) life peers', 'Elizabethtown College alumni', 'First Ministers of Northern Ireland', 'Lawyers from Belfast', 'Leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party', 'Life peers created by Elizabeth II', 'Male non-fiction writers from Northern Ireland', 'Members of the Bar of Northern Ireland', 'Members of the Freedom Association', 'Members of the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention', 'Members of the Northern Ireland Forum', 'Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Upper Bann', 'Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom', 'Ministers of the Northern Ireland Executive (since 1999)', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobel laureates from Northern Ireland', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Northern Ireland MLAs 1998–2003', 'Northern Ireland MLAs 2003–2007', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages containing London Gazette template with parameter supp set to y', 'Pages containing links to subscription-only content', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People educated at Bangor Grammar School', 'Place of death missing', 'Presbyterians from Northern Ireland', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'UK MPs 1987–1992', 'UK MPs 1992–1997', 'UK MPs 1997–2001', 'UK MPs 2001–2005', 'Ulster Unionist Party MLAs', 'Ulster Unionist Party members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom', 'Use British English from January 2013', 'Use dmy dates from July 2022', 'Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party politicians']",59,538

In his time he was ""arguably the most widely performed contemporary playwright in world theatre"". Much of his dramatic work depends on improvisation and comprises the recovery of ""illegitimate"" forms of theatre, such as those performed by giullari (medieval strolling players) and, more famously, the ancient Italian style of commedia dell'arte.His plays have been translated into 30 languages and performed across the world, including in Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Iran, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia. His work of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s is peppered with criticisms of assassinations, corruption, organised crime, racism, Roman Catholic theology, and war. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he took to lampooning Forza Italia and its leader Silvio Berlusconi, while his targets of the 2010s included the banks amid the European sovereign-debt crisis. Also in the 2010s, he became the main ideologue of the Five Star Movement, the anti-establishment party led by Beppe Grillo, often referred to by its members as ""the Master"".Fo's solo pièce célèbre, titled Mistero Buffo and performed across Europe, Asia, Canada and Latin America over a 30-year period, is recognised as one of the most controversial and popular spectacles in postwar European theatre and has been denounced by Cardinal Ugo Poletti, Cardinal Vicar for the Diocese of Rome, as ""the most blasphemous show in the history of television"". The title of the original English translation of Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga! (Can't Pay? Won't Pay!) has passed into the English language, and the play is described as capturing ""something universal in actions and reactions of the working class"".His receipt of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature marked the ""international acknowledgment of Fo as a major figure in twentieth-century world theatre"".

He received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature. Among his best-known works is Death of a Naturalist (1966), his first major published volume. Heaney was and is still recognised as one of the principal contributors to poetry in Ireland during his lifetime. American poet Robert Lowell described him as ""the most important Irish poet since Yeats"", and many others, including the academic John Sutherland, have said that he was ""the greatest poet of our age"". Robert Pinsky has stated that ""with his wonderful gift of eye and ear Heaney has the gift of the story-teller."" Upon his death in 2013, The Independent described him as ""probably the best-known poet in the world"".Heaney was born in the townland of Tamniaran between Castledawson and Toomebridge, Northern Ireland. His family moved to nearby Bellaghy when he was a boy. He became a lecturer at St. Joseph's College in Belfast in the early 1960s, after attending Queen's University and began to publish poetry. He lived in Sandymount, Dublin, from 1976 until his death. He lived part-time in the United States from 1981 to 2006.
Heaney was a professor at Harvard from 1981 to 1997, and its Poet in Residence from 1988 to 2006. From 1989 to 1994, he was also the Professor of Poetry at Oxford. In 1996 he was made a Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and in 1998 was bestowed the title Saoi of the Aosdána. Other awards that he received include the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize (1968), the E. M. Forster Award (1975), the PEN Translation Prize (1985), the Golden Wreath of Poetry (2001), the T. S. Eliot Prize (2006) and two Whitbread Prizes (1996 and 1999). In 2011, he was awarded the Griffin Poetry Prize and in 2012, a Lifetime Recognition Award from the Griffin Trust.

Goodman, from whom his middle name came. He earned a BA in biology with major in biochemistry from Yale University. Immediately after graduation in 1962, he worked with Allan Conney at Burroughs Wellcome & Company, which resulted in the publication of his first two technical papers. Persuaded by Earl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr., he joined Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine for an MD-PhD course. He obtained his degree in 1969. He then went to the National Institutes of Health to work with Marshall Nirenberg between 1969 and 1971.
Gilman became assistant professor of pharmacology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine in 1971, and full professor in 1977. He chaired the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas from 1981. Upon his retirement in 2009, he was appointed chief scientific officer of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. He resigned in 2012. He was the founder of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals company and the Alliance for Cellular Signaling. From 2005, he was also director of Eli Lilly and Company.
G proteins are a vital intermediary between the extracellular activation of receptors (G protein-coupled receptors) on the cell membrane and actions within the cell. Rodbell had shown in the 1960s that GTP was involved in cell signaling.  It was Gilman who actually discovered the proteins that interacted with the GTP to initiate signalling cascades within the cell, and thus, giving the name G proteins.For his works, he received the Canada Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1984, Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research and the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize in 1989, in addition to Nobel Prize.

345,Yasser Arafat,The Nobel Peace Prize,1994,1929,Egypt,2004, 1/3 ,, “for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East” ,,,,,"Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini (4 / 24: 269  August 1929 – 11 November 2004), popularly known as Yasser Arafat ( ARR-ə-fat, also US:  AR-ə-FAHT; Arabic: محمد ياسر عبد الرحمن عبد الرؤوف عرفات القدوة الحسيني, romanized: Muḥammad Yāsir ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ʻAbd al-Raʼūf ʿArafāt al-Qudwa al-Ḥusaynī‎; Arabic: ياسر عرفات, romanized: Yāsir ʿArafāt) or by his kunya Abu Ammar (Arabic: أبو عمار, romanized: ʾAbū ʿAmmār), was a Palestinian political leader. He was Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from 1969 to 2004 and President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) from 1994 to 2004. Ideologically an Arab nationalist and a socialist, he was a founding member of the Fatah political party, which he led from 1959 until 2004.
Arafat was born to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where he spent most of his youth and studied at the University of King Fuad I. While a student, he embraced Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Following the defeat of Arab forces, Arafat returned to Cairo and served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956. 
In the latter part of the 1950s, Arafat co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organization seeking the removal of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. In the latter part of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and in 1969 was elected chair of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon. There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions.
From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based himself in Tunisia, and began to shift his approach from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged in a series of negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. The success of the negotiations in Oslo led to Arafat being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, alongside Israeli Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, in 1994. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.Arafat remains a controversial figure.

He was a member of twelve cabinets and represented five political parties in a political career spanning 70 years. Peres was elected to the Knesset in November 1959 and except for a three-month-long interregnum in early 2006, served as a member of the Knesset continuously until he was elected president in 2007. Serving in the Knesset for 48 years (with the first uninterrupted stretch lasting more than 46 years), Peres is the longest serving member in the Knesset's history. At the time of his retirement from politics in 2014, he was the world's oldest head of state and was considered the last link to Israel's founding generation.From a young age, he was renowned for his oratorical brilliance, and was chosen as a protégé by David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founding father. He began his political career in the late 1940s, holding several diplomatic and military positions during and directly after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. His first high-level government position was as deputy director general of defense in 1952 which he attained at the age of 28, and director general from 1953 until 1959. In 1956, he took part in the historic negotiations on the Protocol of Sèvres described by British Prime Minister Anthony Eden as the ""highest form of statesmanship"". In 1963, he held negotiations with U.S. President John F. Kennedy, which resulted in the sale of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Israel, the first sale of U.S. military equipment to Israel. Peres represented Mapai, Rafi, the Alignment, Labor and Kadima in the Knesset, and led Alignment and Labor.Peres first succeeded Yitzhak Rabin as acting prime minister briefly during 1977, before becoming prime minister from 1984 to 1986. As foreign minister under Prime Minister Rabin, Peres engineered the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, and won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize together with Rabin and Yasser Arafat for the Oslo Accords peace talks with the Palestinian leadership. In 1996, he founded the Peres Center for Peace, which has the aim of ""promot[ing] lasting peace and advancement in the Middle East by fostering tolerance, economic and technological development, cooperation and well-being.""

He was the fifth Prime Minister of Israel, serving two terms in office, 1974–77, and from 1992 until his assassination in 1995.
Rabin was born in Jerusalem to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe and was raised in a Labor Zionist household. He learned agriculture in school and excelled as a student. He led a 27-year career as a soldier and ultimately attained the rank of Rav Aluf. As a teenager he joined the Palmach, the commando force of the Yishuv. He eventually rose through its ranks to become its chief of operations during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He joined the newly formed Israel Defense Forces in late 1948 and continued to rise as a promising officer. He helped shape the training doctrine of the IDF in the early 1950s, and led the IDF's Operations Directorate from 1959 to 1963. He was appointed Chief of the General Staff in 1964 and oversaw Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War.
Rabin served as Israel's ambassador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, during a period of deepening U.S.–Israel ties. He was appointed Prime Minister of Israel in 1974 after the resignation of Golda Meir. In his first term, Rabin signed the Sinai Interim Agreement and ordered the Entebbe raid. He resigned in 1977 in the wake of a financial scandal. Rabin was Israel's minister of defense for much of the 1980s, including during the outbreak of the First Intifada.
In 1992, Rabin was re-elected as prime minister on a platform embracing the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. He signed several historic agreements with the Palestinian leadership as part of the Oslo Accords.  In 1994, Rabin won the Nobel Peace Prize together with long-time political rival Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Rabin also signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. In November 1995, he was assassinated by an extremist named Yigal Amir, who opposed the terms of the Oslo Accords. Amir was convicted of Rabin's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Rabin was the first native-born prime minister of Israel and was the only prime minister to be assassinated and the second to die in office after Levi Eshkol.

Nash and fellow game theorists John Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten were awarded the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. In 2015, he and Louis Nirenberg were awarded the Abel Prize for their contributions to the field of partial differential equations.
As a graduate student in the Princeton University Department of Mathematics, Nash introduced a number of concepts (including Nash equilibrium and the Nash bargaining solution) which are now considered  central to game theory and its applications in various sciences. In the 1950s, Nash discovered and proved the Nash embedding theorems by solving a system of nonlinear partial differential equations arising in Riemannian geometry. This work, also introducing a preliminary form of the Nash–Moser theorem, was later recognized by the American Mathematical Society with the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research. Ennio De Giorgi and Nash found, with separate methods, a body of results paving the way for a systematic understanding of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Their De Giorgi–Nash theorem on the smoothness of solutions of such equations resolved Hilbert's nineteenth problem on regularity in the calculus of variations, which had been a well-known open problem for almost sixty years.
In 1959, Nash began showing clear signs of mental illness, and spent several years at psychiatric hospitals being treated for schizophrenia. After 1970, his condition slowly improved, allowing him to return to academic work by the mid-1980s. Nash was biographed in Sylvia Nasar's 1998 book A Beautiful Mind, and his struggles with his illness and his recovery became the basis for a film of the same name directed by Ron Howard, in which Nash was portrayed by Russell Crowe.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.,90,"['1928 births', '2015 deaths', '20th-century American mathematicians', 'Abel Prize laureates', 'American Nobel laureates', 'American atheists', 'American scientists with disabilities', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DBLP identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MATHSN identifiers', 'Articles with MGP identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with ZBMATH identifiers', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Board game designers', 'CS1 Italian-language sources (it)', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 maint', 'Carnegie Mellon University alumni', 'Differential geometers', 'Fellows of the American Mathematical Society', 'Fellows of the Econometric Society', 'Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences', 'Game theorists', 'Illeists', 'Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars', 'John von Neumann Theory Prize winners', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Science faculty', 'Mathematicians from New Jersey', 'Mathematicians from West Virginia', 'McLean Hospital patients', 'Members of the American Philosophical Society', 'Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Nobel laureates in Economics', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'PDE theorists', 'Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata', 'Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch', 'People from Bluefield, West Virginia', 'People from West Windsor, New Jersey', 'People with schizophrenia', 'Princeton University alumni', 'Princeton University faculty', 'Road incident deaths in New Jersey', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Use mdy dates from November 2022', 'Webarchive template wayback links']",72,28

Her first novel, The Bluest Eye, was published in 1970. The critically acclaimed Song of Solomon (1977) brought her national attention and won the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 1988, Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize for Beloved (1987); she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993.Born and raised in Lorain, Ohio, Morrison graduated from Howard University in 1953 with a B.A. in English. She earned a master's degree in American Literature from Cornell University in 1955. In 1957 she returned to Howard University, was married, and had two children before divorcing in 1964. Morrison became the first black female editor in fiction at Random House in New York City in the late 1960s. She developed her own reputation as an author in the 1970s and '80s. Her work Beloved was made into a film in 1998. Morrison's works are praised for addressing the harsh consequences of racism in the United States and the Black American experience.
The National Endowment for the Humanities selected Morrison for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities, in 1996. She was honored with the National Book Foundation's Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters the same year. President Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on May 29, 2012. She received the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction in 2016.

358,Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela,The Nobel Peace Prize,1993,1918,South Africa,2013, 1/2 ,," “for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa” ",,,,,"Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (; Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid activist and politician who served as the first president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.
A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state.
Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, his administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services. Internationally, Mandela acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.
Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Globally regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, and described as the ""Father of the Nation"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela,217,"['1918 births', '2013 deaths', '20th-century Methodists', '20th-century South African lawyers', '20th-century South African male writers', '20th-century South African politicians', '20th-century philanthropists', '21st-century Methodists', '21st-century South African philanthropists', '21st-century South African politicians', 'African and Black nationalists', 'All Wikipedia articles written in South African English', 'All articles lacking reliable references', 'Alumni of University of London Worldwide', 'Alumni of the University of London', 'Anti-apartheid activists', 'Anti-capitalists', 'Articles lacking reliable references from April 2023', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NCL identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NLR identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with TePapa identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with ULAN identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Bailiffs Grand Cross of the Order of St John', 'Burials in South Africa', 'Collars of the Order of Isabella the Catholic', 'Congressional Gold Medal recipients', 'Deaths from respiratory tract infection', 'Featured articles', 'Grand Commanders of the Order of the Federal Republic', 'HIV/AIDS activists', 'Honorary Companions of the Order of Australia', 'Honorary Companions of the Order of Canada', 'Honorary Companions of the Order of the Star of Ghana', ""Honorary King's Counsel"", 'Honorary members of the Order of Merit', 'Infectious disease deaths in South Africa', 'Inmates of Robben Island', 'International Simón Bolívar Prize recipients', 'Members of the National Assembly of South Africa', 'Members of the South African Communist Party', 'Nelson Mandela', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata', 'Pages using embedded infobox templates with the title parameter', 'People acquitted of treason', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People from King Sabata Dalindyebo Local Municipality', 'Political prisoners', 'Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients', 'Presidents of South Africa', 'Presidents of the African National Congress', 'Recipients of the Bharat Ratna', 'Recipients of the Four Freedoms Award', 'Recipients of the Gandhi Peace Prize', 'Recipients of the Lenin Peace Prize', 'Recipients of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise, 1st class', 'Respiratory disease deaths in South Africa', 'Saboteurs', 'Sakharov Prize laureates', 'Secretaries-General of the Non-Aligned Movement', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'South African Marxist writers', 'South African Methodists', 'South African Nobel laureates', 'South African autobiographers', 'South African humanitarians', 'South African nationalists', 'South African philanthropists', 'South African prisoners and detainees', 'South African revolutionaries', 'South African socialists', 'UMkhonto we Sizwe personnel', 'University of Fort Hare alumni', 'University of South Africa alumni', 'University of the Witwatersrand alumni', 'Use South African English from June 2023', 'Use dmy dates from July 2023', 'Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages', 'World Rugby Hall of Fame inductees', 'Xhosa people']",119,12
359,Frederik Willem de Klerk,The Nobel Peace Prize,1993,1936,South Africa,2021, 1/2 ,," “for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa” ",,,,,"Frederik Willem de Klerk  (, Afrikaans: [ˈfriədərək ˈvələm də ˈklɛrk]; 18 March 1936 – 11 November 2021) was a South African politician who served as a state president of South Africa from 1989 to 1994 and as deputy president from 1994 to 1996. As South Africa's last head of state from the era of white-minority rule, he and his government dismantled the apartheid system and introduced universal suffrage. Ideologically a conservative and an economic liberal, he led the National Party (NP) from 1989 to 1997.
Born in Johannesburg to an influential Afrikaner family, de Klerk studied at Potchefstroom University before pursuing a career in law. Joining the NP, to which he had family ties, he was elected to parliament and sat in the white-minority government of P. W. Botha, holding a succession of ministerial posts. As a minister, he supported and enforced apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged white South Africans. After Botha resigned in 1989, de Klerk replaced him, first as leader of the NP and then as State President. Although observers expected him to continue Botha's defence of apartheid, de Klerk decided to end the policy. He was aware that growing ethnic animosity and violence was leading South Africa into a racial civil war. Amid this violence, the state security forces committed widespread human rights abuses and encouraged violence between the Xhosa and Zulu people, although de Klerk later denied sanctioning such actions. He permitted anti-apartheid marches to take place, legalised a range of previously banned anti-apartheid political parties, and freed imprisoned anti-apartheid activists such as Nelson Mandela. He also dismantled South Africa's nuclear weapons program.
De Klerk negotiated with Mandela to fully dismantle apartheid and establish a transition to universal suffrage. In 1993, he publicly apologised for apartheid's harmful effects. He oversaw the 1994 non-racial election in which Mandela led the African National Congress (ANC) to victory; de Klerk's NP took second place. De Klerk then became Deputy President in Mandela's ANC-led coalition, the Government of National Unity. In this position, he supported the government's continued liberal economic policies but opposed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate past human rights abuses because he wanted total amnesty for political crimes. His working relationship with Mandela was strained, although he later spoke fondly of him. In May 1996, after the NP objected to the new constitution, de Klerk withdrew it from the coalition government; the party disbanded the following year and reformed as the New National Party. In 1997, he retired from active politics and thereafter lectured internationally.
De Klerk was a controversial figure among many sections of South African society. He received many awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize for dismantling apartheid and bringing universal suffrage to South Africa. Conversely, he received criticism from anti-apartheid activists for offering only a qualified apology for apartheid, and for ignoring the human rights abuses by state security forces. He was also condemned by pro-apartheid Afrikaners, who contended that by abandoning apartheid, he betrayed the interests of the country's Afrikaner minority.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._de_Klerk,78,"['1936 births', '2021 deaths', '20th-century South African lawyers', '20th-century South African politicians', 'Afrikaner anti-apartheid activists', 'Afrikaner people', 'All Wikipedia articles written in South African English', 'All pages needing factual verification', 'Alumni of Monument High School', 'Anti–nuclear weapons activists', 'Apartheid government', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 errors', 'Children of presidents', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Deaths from cancer in South Africa', 'Deaths from mesothelioma', 'Deputy presidents of South Africa', 'Education ministers of South Africa', 'Members of the American Philosophical Society', 'Members of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa', 'Members of the House of Assembly (South Africa)', 'Members of the National Assembly of South Africa', 'Ministers of Home Affairs of South Africa', 'National Party (South Africa) politicians', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'North-West University alumni', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People from Johannesburg', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'South African Ministers for Sport and Recreation', 'South African Nobel laureates', 'South African people of Austrian descent', 'South African people of Dutch descent', 'South African people of Indian descent', 'State Presidents of South Africa', 'Use South African English from July 2023', 'Use dmy dates from March 2023', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from November 2021']",62,5

Economist Justin Wolfers called him ""the most important social scientist in the past 50 years.""Becker was one of the first economists to analyze topics that had been researched in sociology, including racial discrimination, crime, family organization, and rational addiction. He argued that many different types of human behavior can be seen as rational and utility-maximizing, including those that are often regarded as self-destructive or irrational. His approach also extended to altruistic aspects of human behavior, which he showed to sometimes have self-serving ends (when individuals' utility is properly defined and measured, that is).

374,Aung San Suu Kyi,The Nobel Peace Prize,1991,1945,Myanmar),, 1/1 ,, “for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights” ,,,,,"Aung San Suu Kyi (; Burmese: အောင်ဆန်းစုကြည်; MLCTS: aung hcan: cu. krany [ʔàʊɰ̃ sʰáɰ̃ sṵ tɕì]; born 19 June 1945), sometimes abbreviated to Suu Kyi, is a Burmese politician, diplomat, author, and a 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who served as State Counsellor of Myanmar (equivalent to a prime minister) and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2016 to 2021. She has served as the leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD) since the party's founding in 1988, and was registered as its chairperson while it was a legal party from 2011 to 2023. She played a vital role in Myanmar's transition from military junta to partial democracy in the 2010s.
The youngest daughter of Aung San, Father of the Nation of modern-day Myanmar, and Khin Kyi, Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon, British Burma. After graduating from the University of Delhi in 1964 and 
St Hugh's College, Oxford in 1968, she worked at the United Nations for three years. She married Michael Aris in 1972, with whom she had two children.
Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the 8888 Uprising of 8 August 1988 and became the General Secretary of the NLD, which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticized the military junta. In the 1990 elections, NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the military government (the State Peace and Development Council – SPDC) refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had been detained before the elections and remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent political prisoners. In 1999, Time magazine named her one of the ""Children of Gandhi"" and his spiritual heir to nonviolence. She survived an assassination attempt in the 2003 Depayin massacre when at least 70 people associated with the NLD were killed.Her party boycotted the 2010 elections, resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). Aung San Suu Kyi became a Pyithu Hluttaw MP while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the 2012 by-elections. In the 2015 elections, her party won a landslide victory, taking 86% of the seats in the Assembly of the Union—well more than the 67% supermajority needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected president and second vice president in the presidential electoral college. Although she was prohibited from becoming the president due to a clause in the constitution—her late husband and children are foreign citizens—she assumed the newly created role of State Counsellor of Myanmar, a role akin to a prime minister or a head of government.
When she ascended to the office of state counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi drew criticism from several countries, organisations and figures over Myanmar's inaction in response to the genocide of the Rohingya people in Rakhine State and refusal to acknowledge that Myanmar's military has committed massacres. Under her leadership, Myanmar also drew criticism for prosecutions of journalists. In 2019, Aung San Suu Kyi appeared in the International Court of Justice where she defended the Burmese military against allegations of genocide against the Rohingya.Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party had won the November 2020 Myanmar general election, was arrested on 1 February 2021 following a coup d'état that returned the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) to power and sparked protests across the country. Several charges were filed against her, and on 6 December 2021, she was sentenced to four years in prison on two of them. Later, on 10 January 2022, she was sentenced to an additional four years on another set of charges. On 12 October 2022, she was convicted of two further charges of corruption and she was sentenced to two terms of three years' imprisonment to be served concurrent to each other.

Coase received a bachelor of commerce degree (1932) and a PhD from the London School of Economics, where he was a member of the faculty until 1951. He was the Clifton R. Musser Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Law School, where he arrived in 1964 and remained for the rest of his life. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1991.
Coase believed economists should study real-world wealth creation, in the manner of Adam Smith, stating, ""It is suicidal for the field to slide into a hard science of choice, ignoring the influences of society, history, culture, and politics on the working of the economy."" He believed economic study should reduce emphasis on Price Theory or theoretical markets and instead focus on real markets. He established the case for the corporation as a means to pay the costs of operating a marketplace. Coase is best known for two articles: ""The Nature of the Firm"" (1937), which introduces the concept of transaction costs to explain the nature and limits of firms; and ""The Problem of Social Cost"" (1960), which suggests that well-defined property rights could overcome the problems of externalities if it were not for transaction costs (see Coase theorem).

383,Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev,The Nobel Peace Prize,1990,1931,USSR (now Russia),2022, 1/1 ,, “for the leading role he played in the radical changes in East-West relations” ,,,,,"Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev (2 March 1931 – 30 August 2022) was a Soviet and Russian politician who served as the eighth and final leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 to the country's dissolution in 1991. He served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 and additionally as head of state beginning in 1988, as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1988 to 1989, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet from 1989 to 1990 and the only President of the Soviet Union from 1990 to 1991. Ideologically, Gorbachev initially adhered to Marxism–Leninism but moved towards social democracy by the early 1990s.
Gorbachev was born in Privolnoye, Russian SFSR, to a poor peasant family of Russian and Ukrainian heritage. Growing up under the rule of Joseph Stalin, in his youth, he operated combine harvesters on a collective farm before joining the Communist Party, which then governed the Soviet Union as a one-party state. Studying at Moscow State University, he married fellow student Raisa Titarenko in 1953 and received his law degree in 1955. Moving to Stavropol, he worked for the Komsomol youth organization and, after Stalin's death, became a keen proponent of the de-Stalinization reforms of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. He was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Stavropol Regional Committee in 1970, overseeing the construction of the Great Stavropol Canal. In 1978, he returned to Moscow to become a Secretary of the party's Central Committee, and in 1979 joined its governing Politburo (25th term). Three years after the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev—following the brief tenures of Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko—in 1985, the Politburo elected Gorbachev as general secretary, the de facto leader.
Although committed to preserving the Soviet state and its Marxist–Leninist ideals, Gorbachev believed significant reform was necessary for survival. He withdrew troops from the Soviet–Afghan War and embarked on summits with United States president Ronald Reagan to limit nuclear weapons and end the Cold War. Domestically, his policy of glasnost (""openness"") allowed for enhanced freedom of speech and press, while his perestroika (""restructuring"") sought to decentralize economic decision-making to improve its efficiency. His democratization measures and formation of the elected Congress of People's Deputies undermined the one-party state. Gorbachev declined to intervene militarily when various Eastern Bloc countries abandoned Marxist–Leninist governance in 1989–1992. Internally, growing nationalist sentiment threatened to break up the Soviet Union, leading Marxist–Leninist hardliners to launch the unsuccessful August Coup against Gorbachev in 1991. In the coup's wake, the Soviet Union dissolved against Gorbachev's wishes. After resigning from the presidency, he launched the Gorbachev Foundation, became a vocal critic of Russian presidents Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, and campaigned for Russia's social-democratic movement. Gorbachev died in Moscow in 2022, at the age of 91.
Gorbachev is considered one of the most significant figures of the second half of the 20th century. The recipient of a wide range of awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize, he is praised for his role in ending the Cold War, introducing new political and economic freedoms in the Soviet Union, and tolerating both the fall of Marxist–Leninist administrations in eastern and central Europe and the German reunification. In Russia, he is often derided for facilitating the dissolution of the Soviet Union—an event which weakened Russia's global influence and precipitated an economic collapse in Russia and other states.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev,150,"['1931 births', '2022 deaths', 'All Wikipedia articles written in American English', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles

408,United Nations Peacekeeping Forces,The Nobel Peace Prize,1988,,,, 1/1 ,, “for preventing armed clashes and creating conditions for negotiations” ,,,,,"Peacekeeping by the United Nations is a role of the UN's Department of Peace Operations as an ""instrument developed by the organization as a way to help countries torn by conflict to create the conditions for lasting peace"". It is distinguished from peacebuilding, peacemaking, and peace enforcement although the United Nations does acknowledge that all activities are ""mutually reinforcing"" and that overlap between them is frequent in practice.Peacekeepers monitor and observe peace processes in post-conflict areas and assist ex-combatants in implementing the peace agreements they may have signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including separating former combatants, confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral assistance, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Accordingly, UN peacekeepers (often referred to as Blue Berets or Blue Helmets because of their light blue berets or helmets) can include soldiers, police officers, and civilian personnel.
Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter gives the United Nations Security Council the power and responsibility to take collective action to maintain international peace and security.
Most of these operations are established and implemented by the United Nations itself, with troops obeying UN operational control. In these cases, peacekeepers remain members of their respective armed forces, and do not constitute an independent ""UN army"", as the UN does not have such a force. In cases where direct UN involvement is not considered appropriate or feasible, the Council authorizes regional organizations such as NATO, the Economic Community of West African States, or coalitions of willing countries to perform peacekeeping or peace-enforcement tasks.
Jean-Pierre Lacroix is the Head of the Department of Peace Operations; he took over from the former Under-Secretary-General Hervé Ladsous on 1 April 2017. Since 1997, all directors have been French.

They formalize the self-regulation of markets, that Keynes refuted, while reiterating some of his ideas.
Born in Paris, France, Allais attended the Lycée Lakanal, graduated from the École Polytechnique in Paris and studied at the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris. His academic and other posts have included being Professor of Economics at the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris (since 1944) and Director of its Economic Analysis Centre (since 1946). In 1949, he received the title of doctor-engineer from the University of Paris, Faculty of Science. He also held teaching positions at various institutions, including at the University of Paris X–Nanterre. His first works oriented him towards the sciences of the concrete and the experiments of fundamental physics, on which he will also publish numerous works, notably on pendular oscillations and the laws of gravitation. It's after a trip in 1933 to the United States during the Great Depression, that he decides to make the economy. Allais died at his home in Saint-Cloud, near Paris, at the age of 99.Allais considered Léon Walras, Wilfredo Pareto, and Irving Fisher to be his primary influences. He was reluctant to write in or translate his work into English, and many of his major contributions became known to the dominant community only when they were independently rediscovered or popularized by English-speaking economists. At the same time, he claimed Keynes's liberalism and declared himself in favor of an important public sector. Allais attended the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society, but he was alone among the attendees to refuse to sign the statement of aims because of a disagreement over the extent of property rights. He exerted an important influence, at the end of the war, on French economists such as Gérard Debreu, Jacques Lesourne, Edmond Malinvaud and Marcel Boiteux.
Paul Samuelson   said ""Had Allais earliest writings been in English, a generation of economic theory would have taken a different course"", and felt the Nobel Prize should have been awarded to him much earlier. Assar Lindbeck, the chairman of the selection committee, considered Allais as ""a giant within the world of economic analysis"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Allais,59,"['1911 births', '2010 deaths', 'Academic staff of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies', 'All articles with bare URLs for citations', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with MATHSN identifiers', 'Articles with MGP identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PDF format bare URLs for citations', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with ZBMATH identifiers', 'Articles with bare URLs for citations from March 2022', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Corps des mines', 'Fellows of the Econometric Society', 'Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences', 'Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences', 'French Nobel laureates', 'French economists', 'French physicists', 'General equilibrium theorists', 'Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour', 'Historians of science', 'Lycée Lakanal alumni', 'Member of the Mont Pelerin Society', 'Members of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques', 'Mines Paris - PSL alumni', 'Nobel laureates in Economics', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'École Polytechnique alumni']",48,14

H. Auden and other supporters. He taught thereafter at Mount Holyoke College, and at universities including Yale, Columbia, Cambridge, and Michigan. Brodsky was awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Literature ""for an all-embracing authorship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity"". He was appointed United States Poet Laureate in 1991.According to Professor Andrey Ranchin of Moscow State University, ""Brodsky is the only modern Russian poet whose body of work has already been awarded the honorary title of a canonized classic...

No other contemporary Russian writer has been honored as the hero of such a number of memoir texts; no other has had so many conferences devoted to them.""

FRSL (Yoruba: Akínwándé Olúwọlé Babátúndé Ṣóyíinká; born 13 July 1934), known as Wole Soyinka (pronounced [wɔlé ʃójĩnká]), is a Nigerian playwright, novelist, poet, and essayist in the English language. He was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, for ""in a wide cultural perspective and with poetic overtones fashioning the drama of existence"", the first sub-Saharan African to be honoured in that category.Soyinka was born into a Yoruba family in Abeokuta. In 1954, he attended Government College in Ibadan, and subsequently University College Ibadan and the University of Leeds in England. After studying in Nigeria and the UK, he worked with the Royal Court Theatre in London. He went on to write plays that were produced in both countries, in theatres and on radio. He took an active role in Nigeria's political history and its campaign for independence from British colonial rule. In 1965, he seized the Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service studio and broadcast a demand for the cancellation of the Western Nigeria Regional Elections. In 1967, during the Nigerian Civil War, he was arrested by the federal government of General Yakubu Gowon and put in solitary confinement for two years, for volunteering to be a non-government mediating actor.Soyinka has been a strong critic of successive Nigerian (and African at large) governments, especially the country's many military dictators, as well as other political tyrannies, including the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. Much of his writing has been concerned with ""the oppressive boot and the irrelevance of the colour of the foot that wears it"". During the regime of General Sani Abacha (1993–98), Soyinka escaped from Nigeria on a motorcycle via the ""NADECO Route."" Abacha later proclaimed a death sentence against him ""in absentia."" With civilian rule restored to Nigeria in 1999, Soyinka returned to his nation.
In Nigeria, Soyinka was a Professor of Comparative literature (1975 to 1999) at the Obafemi Awolowo University, then called the University of Ifẹ̀. With civilian rule restored to Nigeria in 1999, he was made professor emeritus. While in the United States, he first taught at Cornell University as Goldwin Smith professor for African Studies and Theatre Arts from 1988 to 1991 and then at Emory University, where in 1996 he was appointed Robert W. Woodruff Professor of the Arts. Soyinka has been a Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and has served as scholar-in-residence at New York University's Institute of African American Affairs and at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. He has also taught at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard and Yale, and was also a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at Duke University in 2008.In December 2017, Soyinka was awarded the Europe Theatre Prize in the ""Special Prize"" category, awarded to someone who has ""contributed to the realization of cultural events that promote understanding and the exchange of knowledge between peoples"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wole_Soyinka,91,"['1934 births', '20th-century Nigerian dramatists and playwrights', '20th-century Nigerian novelists', '20th-century Nigerian philosophers', '20th-century Nigerian poets', '20th-century essayists', '20th-century translators', '21st-century Nigerian novelists', '21st-century Nigerian poets', '21st-century dramatists and playwrights', '21st-century essayists', 'Academic staff of Obafemi Awolowo University', 'Academic staff of the University of Lagos', 'Academics of the University of Oxford', 'All articles with bare URLs for citations', 'Alumni of University of London Worldwide', 'Alumni of the University of Leeds', 'Alumni of the University of London', 'Articles with ADK identifiers', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PDF format bare URLs for citations', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with bare URLs for citations from March 2022', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 Italian-language sources (it)', 'Commanders of the Order of the Federal Republic', 'Cornell University faculty', 'Emory University faculty', 'English-language writers from Nigeria', 'Fellows of Churchill College, Cambridge', 'Fellows of the African Academy of Sciences', 'Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature', 'Former Anglicans', 'Government College, Ibadan alumni', 'Granta people', 'Harvard University faculty', 'Living people', 'Loyola Marymount University faculty', 'New York University faculty', 'Nigerian Civil War prisoners of war', 'Nigerian Nobel laureates', 'Nigerian atheists', 'Nigerian dramatists and playwrights', 'Nigerian essayists', 'Nigerian expatriate academics in the United States', 'Nigerian expatriates in the United Kingdom', 'Nigerian humanists', 'Nigerian male novelists', 'Nigerian male poets', 'Nigerian memoirists', 'Nigerian philosophers', 'Nigerian prisoners and detainees', 'Nigerian speculative fiction writers', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People educated at Abeokuta Grammar School', 'Political philosophers', 'Prisoners and detainees of Nigeria', 'Ransome-Kuti family', 'Recipients of the Nigerian National Order of Merit Award', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'University of Ibadan alumni', 'University of Nevada, Las Vegas faculty', 'Use Nigerian English from April 2023', 'Use dmy dates from November 2020', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2012', 'Writers from Abeokuta', 'Yale University faculty', 'Yoruba academics', 'Yoruba dramatists and playwrights', 'Yoruba novelists', 'Yoruba philosophers', 'Yoruba poets', 'Yoruba writers', 'Yoruba–English translators']",105,369

In his political activities, he also campaigned for victims of oppression in places like South Africa, Nicaragua, Kosovo, and Sudan. He publicly condemned the 1915 Armenian genocide and remained a strong defender of human rights during his lifetime. He was described as ""the most important Jew in America"" by the Los Angeles Times in 2003.Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. The Norwegian Nobel Committee called him a ""messenger to mankind"", stating that through his struggle to come to terms with ""his own personal experience of total humiliation and of the utter contempt for humanity shown in Hitler's death camps"", as well as his ""practical work in the cause of peace"", Wiesel delivered a message ""of peace, atonement, and human dignity"" to humanity.

Secondly, it was known that the immune system learns to be tolerant to the individual's own self. Jerne postulated that this learning takes place in the thymus. Thirdly, it was known that T cells and B cells communicate with each other.Jerne's network theory proposed that the active sites of antibodies are attracted to both specific antigens (idiotypes) and to other antibodies that bind to the same site.

He was Bishop of Johannesburg from 1985 to 1986 and then Archbishop of Cape Town from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the first black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to fuse ideas from black theology with African theology.
Tutu was born of mixed Xhosa and Motswana heritage to a poor family in Klerksdorp, South Africa. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married Nomalizo Leah Tutu, with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study theology at King's College London. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the Federal Theological Seminary and then the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. In 1972, he became the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based in London but necessitating regular tours of the African continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as dean of St Mary's Cathedral in Johannesburg and then as Bishop of Lesotho; from 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the South African Council of Churches. He emerged as one of the most prominent opponents of South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation and white minority rule. Although warning the National Party government that anger at apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed non-violent protest and foreign economic pressure to bring about universal suffrage.
In 1985, Tutu became Bishop of Johannesburg and in 1986 the Archbishop of Cape Town, the most senior position in southern Africa's Anglican hierarchy. In this position, he emphasised a consensus-building model of leadership and oversaw the introduction of female priests. Also in 1986, he became president of the All Africa Conference of Churches, resulting in further tours of the continent. After President F. W. de Klerk released the anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990 and the pair led negotiations to end apartheid and introduce multi-racial democracy, Tutu assisted as a mediator between rival black factions. After the 1994 general election resulted in a coalition government headed by Mandela, the latter selected Tutu to chair the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses committed by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. Following apartheid's fall, Tutu campaigned for gay rights and spoke out on a wide range of subjects, among them his criticism of South African presidents Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma, his opposition to the Iraq War, and describing Israel's treatment of Palestinians as apartheid. In 2010, he retired from public life.
As Tutu rose to prominence in the 1970s, different socio-economic groups and political classes held a wide range of views about him, from critical to admiring. He was popular among South Africa's black majority and was internationally praised for his work involving anti-apartheid activism, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize and other international awards. He also compiled several books of his speeches and sermons.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu,90,"['1931 births', '2021 deaths', '20th-century Anglican Church of Southern Africa bishops', '20th-century Anglican archbishops', '20th-century South African male writers', '21st-century South African male writers', 'Academic staff of the National University of Lesotho', 'African democratic socialists', 'All Wikipedia articles written in South African English', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with unsourced statements', ""Alumni of King's College London"", 'Alumni of the University of London', 'Anglican anti-apartheid activists', 'Anglican archbishops of Cape Town', 'Anglican bishops of Johannesburg', 'Anglican bishops of Lesotho', 'Anglican socialists', 'Anglican writers', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KANTO identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2022', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2023', 'Bates College alumni', 'Commanders of the Order of Orange-Nassau', 'Commanders of the Order of St John', 'Deans of Johannesburg', 'Deaths from cancer in South Africa', 'Deaths from prostate cancer', 'Desmond Tutu', 'Euthanasia activists', ""Fellows of King's College London"", 'Fellows of the African Academy of Sciences', 'Good articles', 'Grand Crosses 1st class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany', 'Grand Officers of the Legion of Honour', 'HIV/AIDS activists', 'Hamilton College (New York) alumni', 'Hamilton College (New York) faculty', 'Honorary Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour', 'Nautilus Book Award winners', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Nonviolence advocates', 'Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata', 'Pages using embedded infobox templates with the title parameter', 'Palestinian solidarity activists', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People from Klerksdorp', 'Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients', 'Recipients of the Four Freedoms Award', 'Recipients of the Gandhi Peace Prize', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Sotho-Tswana people', 'South African Anglicans', 'South African LGBT rights activists', 'South African Nobel laureates', 'South African Sotho people', 'South African Tswana people', 'South African anti-communists', 'South African anti-poverty advocates', 'South African democracy activists', 'South African humanitarians', 'South African male non-fiction writers', 'South African revolutionaries', 'South African socialists', 'Sustainability advocates', 'Templeton Prize laureates', 'Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa) people', 'University of South Africa alumni', 'Use South African English from September 2013', 'Use dmy dates from September 2022', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from January 2022']",105,4

He shared the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics with William A. Fowler for ""...theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars"". His mathematical treatment of stellar evolution yielded many of the current theoretical models of the later evolutionary stages of massive stars and black holes. Many concepts, institutions, and inventions, including the Chandrasekhar limit and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, are named after him.Chandrasekhar worked on a wide variety of problems in physics during his lifetime, contributing to the contemporary understanding of stellar structure, white dwarfs, stellar dynamics, stochastic process, radiative transfer, the quantum theory of the hydrogen anion, hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability, turbulence, equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium, general relativity, mathematical theory of black holes and theory of colliding gravitational waves. At the University of Cambridge, he developed a theoretical model explaining the structure of white dwarf stars that took into account the relativistic variation of mass with the velocities of electrons that comprise their degenerate matter. He showed that the mass of a white dwarf could not exceed 1.44 times that of the Sun – the Chandrasekhar limit. Chandrasekhar revised the models of stellar dynamics first outlined by Jan Oort and others by considering the effects of fluctuating gravitational fields within the Milky Way on stars rotating about the galactic centre. His solution to this complex dynamical problem involved a set of twenty partial differential equations, describing a new quantity he termed ""dynamical friction"", which has the dual effects of decelerating the star and helping to stabilize clusters of stars. Chandrasekhar extended this analysis to the interstellar medium, showing that clouds of galactic gas and dust are distributed very unevenly.
Chandrasekhar studied at Presidency College, Madras (now Chennai) and the University of Cambridge.  A long-time professor at the University of Chicago, he did some of his studies at the Yerkes Observatory, and served as editor of The Astrophysical Journal from 1952 to 1971.

McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader of the development of maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research for the rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized as among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.
During the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock discovered transposition and used it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.
Later, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany of maize races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and protein expression that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; as of 2022, she remains the only woman who has received an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_McClintock,77,"['1902 births', '1992 deaths', '20th-century American botanists', '20th-century American women scientists', 'All Wikipedia articles written in American English', 'American Nobel laureates', 'American botanists', 'American geneticists', 'American people of British descent', 'American women biologists', 'American women botanists', 'American women geneticists', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Scopus identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Biography with signature', 'CS1 maint', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences alumni', 'Erasmus Hall High School alumni', 'Evolutionary biologists', 'Featured articles', 'Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'Foreign Members of the Royal Society', 'MacArthur Fellows', 'Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences', 'National Medal of Science laureates', 'Nobel laureates affiliated with Missouri', 'Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research', 'Scientists from Brooklyn', 'Scientists from Columbia, Missouri', 'Scientists from Hartford, Connecticut', 'Scientists from Missouri', 'Scientists from New York (state)', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Theoretical biologists', 'University of Missouri faculty', 'Use American English from June 2023', 'Use mdy dates from July 2021', 'Wolf Prize in Medicine laureates', 'Women Nobel laureates', 'Women evolutionary biologists', 'Women food scientists', 'Women physiologists']",67,128

After winning the 1990 election, Wałęsa became the first democratically elected President of Poland since 1926 and the first-ever Polish president elected by popular vote. A shipyard electrician by trade, Wałęsa became the leader of the Solidarity movement, and led a successful pro-democratic effort, which in 1989 ended Communist rule in Poland and ushered in the end of the Cold War.
While working at the Lenin Shipyard (now Gdańsk Shipyard), Wałęsa, an electrician, became a trade-union activist, for which he was persecuted by the government, placed under surveillance, fired in 1976, and arrested several times. In August 1980, he was instrumental in political negotiations that led to the ground-breaking Gdańsk Agreement between striking workers and the government. He co-founded the Solidarity trade-union, whose membership rose to over ten million.
After martial law in Poland was imposed and Solidarity was outlawed, Wałęsa was again arrested. Released from custody, he continued his activism and was prominent in the establishment of the Round Table Agreement that led to the semi-free 1989 Polish legislative election and a Solidarity-led government. He presided over Poland's transition from Marxist–Leninist state socialism into a free-market capitalist liberal democracy, but his active role in Polish politics diminished after he narrowly lost the 1995 Polish presidential election. In 1995, he established the Lech Wałęsa Institute.
Since 1980, Wałęsa has received hundreds of prizes, honors and awards from multiple countries and organizations worldwide. He was named the Time Person of the Year (1981) and one of Time's 100 most important people of the 20th century (1999). He has received over forty honorary degrees, including from Harvard University and Columbia University, as well as dozens of the highest state orders, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and the French Grand Cross of Legion of Honour. In 1989, Wałęsa was the first foreign non-head of state to address the Joint Meeting of the U.S. Congress.

Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, particularly in the Spanish language, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha Pardo; they had two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo.García Márquez started as a journalist and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), Chronicle of a Death Foretold (1981), and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style known as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in the fictional village of Macondo (mainly inspired by his birthplace, Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude. He is the most-translated Spanish-language author.Upon García Márquez's death in April 2014, Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, called him ""the greatest Colombian who ever lived.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez,152,"['1927 births', '2014 deaths', '20th-century Colombian novelists', '20th-century Colombian poets', '20th-century Colombian writers', '20th-century essayists', '20th-century journalists', '20th-century non-fiction writers', '20th-century screenwriters', '20th-century short story writers', '21st-century Colombian novelists', '21st-century Colombian poets', '21st-century Colombian writers', '21st-century essayists', '21st-century journalists', '21st-century memoirists', '21st-century non-fiction writers', '21st-century screenwriters', '21st-century short story writers', 'All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Spanish-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from March 2019', 'Articles with ADK identifiers', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with BNMM identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KANTO identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with RISM identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with WorldCat Entities identifiers', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2014', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1', 'Colombian Nobel laureates', 'Colombian autobiographers', 'Colombian essayists', 'Colombian expatriates in Mexico', 'Colombian literature', 'Colombian male novelists', 'Colombian male poets', 'Colombian male short story writers', 'Colombian male writers', 'Colombian non-fiction writers', 'Colombian political writers', 'Colombian screenwriters', 'Colombian socialists', 'Colombian writers', 'Deaths from pneumonia in Mexico', 'Fabulists', 'Gabriel García Márquez', 'Good articles', 'Magic realism writers', 'Male screenwriters', 'Memoirists', 'Mestizo writers', 'National University of Colombia alumni', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata', 'People from Magdalena Department', ""People with Alzheimer's disease"", 'Postmodern writers', 'Recipients of the Legion of Honour', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'South American writers', 'Speechwriters', 'Surrealist writers', 'Urban fantasy writers', 'Use dmy dates from January 2022', 'Weird fiction writers', 'Writers about activism and social change', 'Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age']",103,1814

He served as a delegate to the 1945 San Francisco Conference that established the United Nations. 
He was ambassador to Brazil from 1962 to 1964, and was state secretary to the ministry of foreign affairs from 1964 to 1970.

He was then appointed  Mexico's permanent representative to the UN's Committee on Disarmament.
García Robles received the Nobel Peace Prize as the driving force behind the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which set up a nuclear-free zone in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The agreement was signed in 1967 by most states in the region, though some states took some time to ratify the agreement.

His academic work included pioneering contributions to the study of investment, monetary and fiscal policy and financial markets. He also proposed an econometric model for censored dependent variables, the well-known tobit model.
Along with fellow neo-Keynesian economist James Meade in 1977, Tobin proposed nominal GDP targeting as a monetary policy rule in 1980.

Regarded as one of the great poets of the 20th century, he won the 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature. In its citation, the Swedish Academy called Miłosz a writer who ""voices man's exposed condition in a world of severe conflicts"".Miłosz survived the German occupation of Warsaw during World War II and became a cultural attaché for the Polish government during the postwar period. When communist authorities threatened his safety, he defected to France and ultimately chose exile in the United States, where he became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. His poetry—particularly about his wartime experience—and his appraisal of Stalinism in a prose book, The Captive Mind, brought him renown as a leading émigré artist and intellectual.
Throughout his life and work, Miłosz tackled questions of morality, politics, history, and faith. As a translator, he introduced Western works to a Polish audience, and as a scholar and editor, he championed a greater awareness of Slavic literature in the West. Faith played a role in his work as he explored his Catholicism and personal experience. He wrote in Polish and English.
Miłosz died in Kraków, Poland, in 2004.

He was the first Pakistani and the first Muslim from an Islamic country to receive a Nobel Prize in science and the second from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize, after Anwar Sadat of Egypt.Salam was scientific advisor to the Ministry of Science and Technology in Pakistan from 1960 to 1974, a position from which he played a major and influential role in the development of the country's science infrastructure. Salam contributed to numerous developments in theoretical and particle physics in Pakistan. He was the founding director of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), and responsible for the establishment of the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG). For this, he is viewed as the ""scientific father"" of this program. In 1974, Abdus Salam departed from his country, in protest, after the Parliament of Pakistan passed unanimously a parliamentary bill declaring members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, not-Muslim for the purpose of constitution, to which Salam belonged. In 1998, following the country's Chagai-I nuclear tests, the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative stamp, as a part of ""Scientists of Pakistan"", to honour the services of Salam.Salam's notable achievements include the Pati–Salam model, magnetic photon, vector meson, Grand Unified Theory, work on supersymmetry and, most importantly, electroweak theory, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Salam made a major contribution in quantum field theory and in the advancement of Mathematics at Imperial College London. With his student, Riazuddin, Salam made important contributions to the modern theory on neutrinos, neutron stars and black holes, as well as the work on modernising quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. As a teacher and science promoter, Salam is remembered as a founder and scientific father of mathematical and theoretical physics in Pakistan during his term as the chief scientific advisor to the president.

Born in Skopje, then part of the Ottoman Empire, at the age of 18 she moved to Ireland and later to India, where she lived most of her life. On 4 September 2016, she was canonised by the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. The anniversary of her death, 5 September, is her feast day.
Mother Teresa founded Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation, which grew to have over 4,500 nuns across 133 countries as of 2012. The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give ""wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.""Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work, but was criticised for her views on abortion and contraception, as well as the poor conditions in her houses for the dying.

He received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1956. Between 1956 and 1957 Smith worked for the Washington University in St. Louis Medical Service. In 1975, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship he spent at the University of Zurich.
In 1970, Smith and Kent W. Wilcox discovered the first type II restriction enzyme, that is now called as HindII. Smith went on to discover DNA methylases that constitute the other half of the bacterial host restriction and modification systems, as hypothesized by Werner Arber of Switzerland.He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1978 for discovering type II restriction enzymes with Werner Arber and Daniel Nathans as co-recipients.
He later became a leading figure in the nascent field of genomics, when in 1995 he and a team at The Institute for Genomic Research sequenced the first bacterial genome, that of Haemophilus influenzae. H. influenza was the same organism in which Smith had discovered restriction enzymes in the late 1960s.  He subsequently played a key role in the sequencing of many of the early genomes at The Institute for Genomic Research, and in the assembly of the human genome at Celera Genomics, which he joined when it was founded in 1998.
More recently, he has directed a team at the J. Craig Venter Institute that works towards creating a partially synthetic bacterium, Mycoplasma laboratorium. In 2003 the same group synthetically assembled the genome of a virus, Phi X 174 bacteriophage.

504,Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat,The Nobel Peace Prize,1978,1918,Egypt,1981, 1/2 ,, “for jointly having negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel in 1978” ,,,,,"Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat (25 December 1918 – 6 October 1981) was an Egyptian politician and military officer who served as the third president of Egypt, from 15 October 1970 until his assassination by fundamentalist army officers on 6 October 1981. Sadat was a senior member of the Free Officers who overthrew King Farouk in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and a close confidant of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, under whom he served as Vice President twice and whom he succeeded as president in 1970. In 1978, Sadat and Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel, signed a peace treaty in cooperation with United States President Jimmy Carter, for which they were recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize.
In his eleven years as president, he changed Egypt's trajectory, departing from many of the political and economic tenets of Nasserism, re-instituting a multi-party system, and launching the Infitah economic policy. As President, he led Egypt in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to regain Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had occupied since the Six-Day War of 1967, making him a hero in Egypt and, for a time, the wider Arab World. Afterwards, he engaged in negotiations with Israel, culminating in the Egypt–Israel peace treaty; this won him and Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize, making Sadat the first Muslim Nobel laureate. Although reaction to the treaty—which resulted in the return of Sinai to Egypt—was generally favorable among Egyptians, it was rejected by the country's Muslim Brotherhood and the left, which felt Sadat had abandoned efforts to ensure a Palestinian state. With the exception of Sudan, the Arab world and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) strongly opposed Sadat's efforts to make a separate peace with Israel without prior consultations with the Arab states. His refusal to reconcile with them over the Palestinian issue resulted in Egypt being suspended from the Arab League from 1979 to 1989. The peace treaty was also one of the primary factors that led to his assassination; on 6 October 1981, militants led by Khalid Islambouli opened fire on Sadat with automatic rifles during the 6 October parade in Cairo, killing him.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_Sadat,100,"['1918 births', '1980s assassinated politicians', '1981 deaths', '1981 murders in Egypt', '20th-century Egyptian military personnel', '20th-century presidents of Egypt', '20th-century prime ministers of Egypt', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with failed verification', 'Anwar Sadat', 'Arab Socialist Union (Egypt) politicians', 'Articles containing Arabic-language text', 'Articles containing video clips', 'Articles with Arabic-language sources (ar)', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with TDVİA identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with dead external links from March 2022', 'Articles with failed verification from April 2021', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with short description', 'Assassinated Egyptian politicians', 'Assassinated heads of state in Africa', 'Assassinated presidents in Africa', 'Burials in Egypt', 'CS1 Arabic-language sources (ar)', 'CS1 errors', 'CS1 errors', 'CS1 maint', 'Commons link from Wikidata', 'Deaths by firearm in Egypt', 'Egyptian Military Academy alumni', 'Egyptian Nobel laureates', 'Egyptian Sunni Muslims', 'Egyptian anti-communists', 'Egyptian nationalists', 'Egyptian people of Sudanese descent', 'Egyptian people of the Yom Kippur War', 'Egyptian politicians convicted of crimes', 'Egyptian social democrats', 'Egyptian terrorism victims', 'Free Officers Movement (Egypt)', 'History of Egypt (1900–present)', 'Honorary Grand Commanders of the Order of the Defender of the Realm', 'Iron Guard of Egypt', 'Knights Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic', 'Male murder victims', 'National Democratic Party (Egypt) politicians', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People from Monufia Governorate', 'People murdered in Egypt', 'Politicide perpetrators', 'Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients', 'Recipients of the Grand Star of the Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria', 'Sadat family', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'Speakers of the Parliament of Egypt', ""Speakers of the People's Assembly of Syria"", 'Terrorism deaths in Egypt', 'Time Person of the Year', 'Use dmy dates from September 2020', 'Vice-presidents of Egypt', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia extended-confirmed-protected pages']",92,0
505,Menachem Begin,The Nobel Peace Prize,1978,1913,Russian Empire (now Belarus),1992, 1/2 ,, “for jointly having negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel in 1978” ,,,,,"Menachem Begin (Hebrew: מְנַחֵם בֵּגִין Menaḥem Begin, pronounced [menaˈχem ˈbeɡin] (listen); Polish: Menachem Begin (Polish documents, 1931–1937); Russian: Менахем Вольфович Бегин, romanized: Menakhem Volfovich Begin; 16 August 1913 – 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel.
Before the creation of the state of Israel, he was the leader of the Zionist militant group Irgun, the Revisionist breakaway from the larger Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah. He proclaimed a revolt, on 1 February 1944, against the British mandatory government, which was opposed by the Jewish Agency. As head of the Irgun, he targeted the British in Palestine. Later, the Irgun fought the Arabs during the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and, as its chief, Begin was described by the British government as the ""leader of the notorious terrorist organisation"" and declined him an entry visa to the United Kingdom between 1953 and 1955. However, Begin's overtures of friendship eventually paid off and he was granted a visa in 1972, five years prior to becoming prime minister.Begin was elected to the first Knesset, as head of Herut, the party he founded, and was at first on the political fringe, embodying the opposition to the Mapai-led government and Israeli establishment. He remained in opposition in the eight consecutive elections (except for a national unity government around the Six-Day War), but became more acceptable to the political center. His 1977 electoral victory and premiership ended three decades of Labor Party political dominance.
Begin's most significant achievement as Prime Minister was the signing of a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, for which he and Anwar Sadat shared the Nobel Prize for Peace. In the wake of the Camp David Accords, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, which had been captured from Egypt in the Six-Day War. Later, Begin's government promoted the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Begin authorized the bombing of the Osirak nuclear plant in Iraq and the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to fight PLO strongholds there, igniting the 1982 Lebanon War. As Israeli military involvement in Lebanon deepened, and the Sabra and Shatila massacre, carried out by Christian Phalangist militia allies of the Israelis, shocked world public opinion, Begin grew increasingly isolated. As IDF forces remained mired in Lebanon and the economy suffered from hyperinflation, the public pressure on Begin mounted. Depressed by the death of his wife Aliza in November 1982, he gradually withdrew from public life, until his resignation in October 1983.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Begin,76,"['1913 births', '1992 deaths', 'All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Hebrew-language text', 'Articles containing Polish-language text', 'Articles containing Russian-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from September 2021', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with Russian-language sources (ru)', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2019', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2010', 'Articles with unsourced statements from July 2011', 'Articles with unsourced statements from May 2021', 'Ashkenazi Jews in Mandatory Palestine', 'Belarusian Jews', 'Belarusian Nobel laureates', 'Betar', 'Burials at the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives', 'CS1 Hebrew-language sources (he)', 'CS1 maint', 'Commons link from Wikidata', 'Foreign Gulag detainees', 'Herut politicians', 'Irgun members', 'Israeli Nobel laureates', 'Israeli anti-communists', 'Israeli people of Belarusian-Jewish descent', 'Israeli torture victims', 'Jewish Israeli politicians', 'Leaders of political parties in Israel', 'Likud leaders', 'Likud politicians', 'Members of the 10th Knesset (1981–1984)', 'Members of the 1st Knesset (1949–1951)', 'Members of the 2nd Knesset (1951–1955)', 'Members of the 3rd Knesset (1955–1959)', 'Members of the 4th Knesset (1959–1961)', 'Members of the 5th Knesset (1961–1965)', 'Members of the 6th Knesset (1965–1969)', 'Members of the 7th Knesset (1969–1974)', 'Members of the 8th Knesset (1974–1977)', 'Members of the 9th Knesset (1977–1981)', 'Menachem Begin', 'Ministers of Agriculture of Israel', 'Ministers of Defense of Israel', 'Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Israel', 'Ministers of Justice of Israel', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People from Brest, Belarus', 'People from Brestsky Uyezd', 'Polish Nobel laureates', 'Polish emigrants to Mandatory Palestine', 'Polish people detained by the NKVD', 'Prime Ministers of Israel', 'Prisoners and detainees of the Soviet Union', 'Revisionist Zionism', 'Rhetoricians', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'University of Warsaw alumni', 'Use dmy dates from July 2020', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia extended-confirmed-protected pages', 'Yishuv during World War II']",90,4102

Aleixandre's early poetry, which he wrote mostly in free verse, is highly surrealistic. It also praises the beauty of nature by using symbols that represent the earth and the sea. Many of Aleixandre's early poems are filled with sadness. They reflect his feeling that people have lost the passion and free spirit that he saw in nature. He was one of the greatest poets of Spanish literature alongside Cernuda and Lorca. The melancholia of his poetry was also the melancholy of failed or ephemeral love affairs.Aleixandre's bisexuality was well known to his circle of friends, but he never admitted it publicly.

The organization has played a notable role on human rights issues due to its frequent citation in media and by world leaders.AI was founded in London in 1961 by the lawyer Peter Benenson. In what he called ""The Forgotten Prisoners"" and ""An Appeal for Amnesty,"" which appeared on the front page of The Observer, a British newspaper, Peter Benenson wrote about two students who toasted to freedom and four other people who had been jailed in other nations because of their beliefs. AI's original focus was prisoners of conscience, with its remit widening in the 1970s, under the leadership of Seán MacBride and Martin Ennals to include miscarriages of justice and torture. In 1977, it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In the 1980s, its secretary general was Thomas Hammarberg, succeeded in the 1990s by Pierre Sané. In the 2000s, it was led by Irene Khan.

He is the only writer to win the National Book Award for Fiction three times, and he received the National Book Foundation's lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1990.In the words of the Swedish Nobel Committee, his writing exhibited

[T]he mixture of rich picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation, all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age.

His best-known works include The Adventures of Augie March, Henderson the Rain King, Herzog, Mr. Sammler's Planet, Seize the Day, Humboldt's Gift, and Ravelstein.
Bellow said that of all his characters, Eugene Henderson, of Henderson the Rain King, was the one most like himself. Bellow grew up as an immigrant from Quebec.

526,Milton Friedman,The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel,1976,1912,USA,2006, 1/1 ,"University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA "," “for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy” ",Northern America,United States,1890,  10 ,"Milton Friedman ( (listen); July 31, 1912 – November 16, 2006) was an American economist and statistician who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy. With George Stigler and others, Friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the Chicago school of economics, a neoclassical school of economic thought associated with the work of the faculty at the University of Chicago that rejected Keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations. Several students, young professors and academics who were recruited or mentored by Friedman at Chicago went on to become leading economists, including Gary Becker, Robert Fogel, Thomas Sowell and Robert Lucas Jr.Friedman's challenges to what he called ""naive Keynesian theory"" began with his interpretation of consumption, which tracks how consumers spend. He introduced a theory which would later become part of the mainstream and among the first to propagate the theory of consumption smoothing. During the 1960s, he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies, and described his approach (along with mainstream economics) as using ""Keynesian language and apparatus"" yet rejecting its initial conclusions. He theorized that there existed a natural rate of unemployment and argued that unemployment below this rate would cause inflation to accelerate. He argued that the Phillips curve was in the long run vertical at the ""natural rate"" and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation. Friedman promoted a macroeconomic viewpoint known as monetarism and argued that a steady, small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy, as compared to rapid, and unexpected changes. His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s. His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve's monetary policy in response to the global financial crisis of 2007–2008.After retiring from the University of Chicago in 1977, and becoming Emeritus professor in economics in 1983, Friedman served as an advisor to Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. His political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal government intervention in social matters. He once stated that his role in eliminating conscription in the United States was his proudest achievement. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, school vouchers and opposition to the war on drugs and support for drug liberalization policies. His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice.Friedman's works cover a broad range of economic topics and public policy issues. His books and essays have had global influence, including in former communist states. A 2011 survey of economists commissioned by the EJW ranked Friedman as the second-most popular economist of the 20th century, following only John Maynard Keynes.

He served in the British Intelligence Service during the First World War, and got imprisoned in concentration camps twice. In recognition of his service, he was granted enrolment at the University of Liège in Belgium to study medicine without any formal education required for the course. He earned his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1928. Devoted to medical research, he initially joined German institutes in Berlin. In 1929 he found an opportunity to join the Rockefeller Institute in New York. At Rockefeller University he made his most groundbreaking achievements in cell biology. In 1930 he developed the technique of cell fractionation, by which he discovered the agent of the Rous sarcoma, components of cell organelles such as mitochondrion, chloroplast, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, ribosome and lysosome. He was the first to employ the electron microscope in the field of biology. In 1945 he published the first detailed structure of cell.

His family returned to Belgium in 1920. He was educated by the Jesuits at Our Lady College, Antwerp, and studied medicine at the Catholic University of Leuven. Upon earning his MD in 1941, he joined research in chemistry, working on insulin and its role in diabetes mellitus. His thesis earned him the highest university degree agrégation de l'enseignement supérieur (equivalent to PhD) in 1945.With his work on the purification of penicillin, he obtained an MSc degree in 1946. He went for further training under (later Nobel Prize winners) Hugo Theorell at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, and Carl and Gerti Cori at the Washington University in St. Louis. He joined the faculty of medicine at Leuven in 1947. In 1960 he was invited to the Rockfeller Institute (now Rockefeller University).

A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist and political philosopher who made contributions to economics, political philosophy, psychology, intellectual history, and other fields. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for work on money and economic fluctuations, and the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. His account of how prices communicate information is widely regarded as an important contribution to economics that led to him receiving the prize.During his teenage years, Hayek fought in World War I. He later said this experience, coupled with his desire to help avoid the mistakes that led to the war, drew him into economics. He earned doctoral degrees in law in 1921 and political science in 1923 from the University of Vienna. He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany. He became a British citizen in 1938. His academic life was mostly spent at the London School of Economics, later at the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. He is widely considered a major contributor to the Austrian School of Economics.Hayek had considerable influence on a variety of political movements of the 20th century, and his ideas continue to influence thinkers from a variety of political backgrounds today. Although sometimes described as a conservative, Hayek himself was uncomfortable with this label and preferred to be thought of as a classical liberal. As the co-founder of the Mont Pelerin Society he contributed to the revival of classical liberalism in the post-war era. His most popular work, The Road to Serfdom, has been republished many times over the eight decades since its original publication.Hayek was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1984 for his academic contributions to economics. He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush.

He shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Nikolaas Tinbergen and Karl von Frisch. He is often regarded as one of the founders of modern ethology, the study of animal behavior. He developed an approach that began with an earlier generation, including his teacher Oskar Heinroth.Lorenz studied instinctive behavior in animals, especially in greylag geese and jackdaws. Working with geese, he investigated the principle of imprinting, the process by which some nidifugous birds (i.e. birds that leave their nest early) bond instinctively with the first moving object that they see within the first hours of hatching. Although Lorenz did not discover the topic, he became widely known for his descriptions of imprinting as an instinctive  bond. In 1936 he met Tinbergen, and the two collaborated in developing ethology as a separate sub-discipline of biology. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Lorenz the 65th most cited scholar of the 20th century in the technical psychology journals, introductory psychology textbooks, and survey responses.Lorenz's work was interrupted by the onset of World War II and in 1941 he was recruited into the German Army as a medic. In 1944, he was sent to the Eastern Front where he was captured by the Soviet Red Army and spent four years as a German prisoner of war in Soviet Armenia. After the war, he regretted his membership in the Nazi Party.Lorenz wrote numerous books, some of which, such as King Solomon's Ring, On Aggression, and Man Meets Dog, became popular reading.

For his actions negotiating a ceasefire in Vietnam, Kissinger received the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize under controversial circumstances.Kissinger was a Jewish refugee who fled Nazi Germany with his family in 1938. Upon arriving in the United States, he excelled academically and graduated from Harvard College in 1950, where he studied under William Yandell Elliott. He earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Harvard University in 1951 and 1954, respectively.
A practitioner of Realpolitik, Kissinger played a prominent role in United States foreign policy between 1969 and 1977, pioneering the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, orchestrating an opening of relations with the People's Republic of China, engaging in what became known as shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East to end the Yom Kippur War, and negotiating the Paris Peace Accords, which ended American involvement in the Vietnam War. Kissinger has also been associated with such controversial policies as the U.S. bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War, U.S. involvement in the 1973 Chilean military coup, a ""green light"" to Argentina's military junta for their Dirty War, and U.S. support for Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War despite a genocide being perpetrated by Pakistan. After leaving government, he formed Kissinger Associates, an international geopolitical consulting firm. Kissinger has written over a dozen books on diplomatic history and international relations.
Kissinger remains a controversial and polarizing figure in U.S. politics, both venerated by some as a highly effective U.S. Secretary of State and condemned by others for allegedly tolerating or supporting war crimes committed by allied nation states during his tenure. A 2015 survey of top international relations scholars, conducted by College of William & Mary, ranked Kissinger as the most effective U.S. secretary of state in the 50 years to 2015.

577,Pablo Neruda,The Nobel Prize in Literature,1971,1904,Chile,1973, 1/1 ,, “for a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a continent's destiny and dreams” ,,,,,"Pablo Neruda (; Spanish: [ˈpaβlo neˈɾuða] (listen))(born Ricardo Eliécer Neftalí Reyes Basoalto; 12 July 1904 – 23 September 1973) was a Chilean poet-diplomat and politician who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Literature. Neruda became known as a poet when he was 13 years old, and wrote in a variety of styles, including surrealist poems, historical epics, political manifestos, a prose autobiography, and passionate love poems such as the ones in his collection Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair (1924).
Neruda occupied many diplomatic positions in various countries during his lifetime and served a term as a Senator for the Chilean Communist Party. When President Gabriel González Videla outlawed communism in Chile in 1948, a warrant was issued for Neruda's arrest. Friends hid him for months in the basement of a house in the port city of Valparaíso, and in 1949 he escaped through a mountain pass near Maihue Lake into Argentina; he would not return to Chile for more than three years. He was a close advisor to Chile's socialist President Salvador Allende, and, when he got back to Chile after accepting his Nobel Prize in Stockholm, Allende invited him to read at the Estadio Nacional before 70,000 people.Neruda was hospitalized with cancer in September 1973, at the time of the coup d'état led by Augusto Pinochet that overthrew Allende's government, but returned home after a few days when he suspected a doctor of injecting him with an unknown substance for the purpose of murdering him on Pinochet's orders.Neruda died at his home in Isla Negra on 23 September 1973, just hours after leaving the hospital. Although it was long reported that he died of heart failure, the Interior Ministry of the Chilean government issued a statement in 2015 acknowledging a Ministry document indicating the government's official position that ""it was clearly possible and highly likely"" that Neruda was killed as a result of ""the intervention of third parties"". However, an international forensic test conducted in 2013 rejected allegations that he was poisoned. It was concluded that he had been suffering from prostate cancer. In 2023, after forensics testing, it was discovered that the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, some strains of which produce toxins, were found in his body. The bacteria were likely injected by medical personnel while Neruda was in a hospital, as he had told his chauffeur Manuel Araya on a phone call shortly before his death.Neruda is often considered the national poet of Chile, and his works have been popular and influential worldwide. The Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez once called him ""the greatest poet of the 20th century in any language"", and the critic Harold Bloom included Neruda as one of the writers central to the Western tradition in his book The Western Canon.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Neruda,124,"['1904 births', '1973 deaths', '20th-century Chilean male writers', '20th-century Chilean poets', '20th-century pseudonymous writers', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with too many examples', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Ambassadors of Chile to France', 'Articles with ADK identifiers', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with BNMM identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KANTO identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with RISM identifiers', 'Articles with RKDartists identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with ULAN identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2018', 'Articles with dead external links from March 2023', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with too many examples from August 2020', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2020', 'Biography with signature', 'CS1 Czech-language sources (cs)', 'CS1 European Spanish-language sources (es-es)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1', 'CS1', 'Chilean Marxists', 'Chilean Nobel laureates', 'Chilean atheists', 'Chilean communists', 'Chilean diplomats', 'Chilean expatriates in Argentina', 'Chilean expatriates in Mexico', 'Chilean expatriates in Spain', 'Chilean male poets', 'Chilean surrealist writers', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Communist Party of Chile politicians', 'Communist poets', 'Death conspiracy theories', 'Deaths by poisoning', 'Deaths from cancer in Chile', 'Deaths from prostate cancer', 'Members of the Senate of Chile', 'National Prize for Literature (Chile) winners', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Pablo Neruda', 'People from Linares Province', 'People of the Spanish Civil War', 'Poet-diplomats', 'Politicians from Santiago', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'Sonneteers', 'Stalin Peace Prize recipients', 'Struga Poetry Evenings Golden Wreath laureates', 'Surrealist poets', 'Use dmy dates from May 2022', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2011', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2021', 'Wikipedia articles with style issues from August 2020']",97,655

He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 for his efforts to strengthen cooperation in western Europe through the EEC and to achieve reconciliation between West Germany and the countries of Eastern Europe. He was the first Social Democratic chancellor since 1930.Fleeing to Norway and then Sweden during the Nazi regime and working as a left-wing journalist, he took the name Willy Brandt as a pseudonym to avoid detection by Nazi agents, and then formally adopted the name in 1948. Brandt was originally considered one of the leaders of the right wing of the SPD, and earned initial fame as Governing Mayor of West Berlin. He served as the foreign minister and as the vice-chancellor in Kurt Georg Kiesinger's cabinet, and became chancellor in 1969.
As chancellor, he maintained West Germany's close alignment with the United States and focused on strengthening European integration in western Europe, while launching the new policy of Ostpolitik aimed at improving relations with Eastern Europe. Brandt was controversial on both the right wing, for his Ostpolitik, and on the left wing, for his support of American policies, including the Vietnam War, and right-wing authoritarian regimes. The Brandt Report became a recognised measure for describing the general North-South divide in world economics and politics between an affluent North and a poor South. Brandt was also known for his fierce anti-communist policies at the domestic level, culminating in the Radikalenerlass (Anti-Radical Decree) in 1972.
In 1970, while visiting a memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising crushed by the Germans, Brandt unexpectedly knelt and meditated in silence, a moment remembered as the Kniefall von Warschau.

A prominent Soviet dissident, Solzhenitsyn was an outspoken critic of communism and helped to raise global awareness of political repression in the Soviet Union, in particular the Gulag system.
Solzhenitsyn was born into a family that defied the Soviet anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and remained devout members of the Russian Orthodox Church. However, Solzhenitsyn lost his faith in Christianity, became an atheist, and embraced Marxism–Leninism. While serving as a captain in the Red Army during World War II, Solzhenitsyn was arrested by SMERSH and sentenced to eight years in the Gulag and then internal exile for criticizing Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in a private letter. As a result of his experience in prison and the camps, he gradually became a philosophically minded Eastern Orthodox Christian.
As a result of the Khrushchev Thaw, Solzhenitsyn was released and exonerated. He pursued writing novels about repression in the Soviet Union and his experiences. He published his first novel, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich in 1962, with approval from Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, which was an account of Stalinist repressions. Solzhenitsyn's last work to be published in the Soviet Union was Matryona's Place in 1963. Following the removal of Khrushchev from power, the Soviet authorities attempted to discourage Solzhenitsyn from continuing to write. He continued to work on further novels and their publication in other countries including Cancer Ward in 1966, In the First Circle in 1968, August 1914 in 1971, and The Gulag Archipelago in 1973, the publication of which outraged the Soviet authorities. In 1974 Solzhenitsyn was deprived of his Soviet citizenship and was flown to West Germany. In 1976, he moved with his family to the United States, where he continued to write. In 1990, shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, his citizenship was restored, and four years later he returned to Russia, where he remained until his death in 2008.
He was awarded the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature ""for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature"", and The Gulag Archipelago was a highly influential work that ""amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state"", and sold tens of millions of copies.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn,116,"['1918 births', '2008 deaths', '20th-century Russian historians', '20th-century Russian short story writers', '20th-century male writers', '20th-century non-fiction writers', 'Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Russian-language text', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with BNMM identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with HDS identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KANTO identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with RSL identifiers', 'Articles with Russian-language sources (ru)', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with dead external links from August 2023', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from February 2023', 'Articles with unsourced statements from July 2011', 'Articles with unsourced statements from May 2011', 'Burials at Donskoy Monastery', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'CS1 Indonesian-language sources (id)', 'CS1 Romanian-language sources (ro)', 'CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 uses Russian-language script (ru)', 'Censorship in the Soviet Union', 'Christian humanists', 'Christian novelists', 'Christian writers', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Converts to Eastern Orthodoxy from atheism or agnosticism', 'Critics of atheism', 'Eastern Orthodox philosophers', 'Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts', 'Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences', 'Gulag detainees', 'Inmates of Lefortovo Prison', 'Male non-fiction writers', 'Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People denaturalized by the Soviet Union', 'People from Cavendish, Vermont', 'People from Kislovodsk', 'People of the Cold War', 'Prison writings', 'Recipients of the Order of the Red Star', 'Russian Christians', 'Russian Nobel laureates', 'Russian Orthodox Christians from Russia', 'Russian Orthodox Christians from the Soviet Union', 'Russian anti-communists', 'Russian exiles', 'Russian humanitarians', 'Russian male novelists', 'Russian male short story writers', 'Russian monarchists', 'Russian nationalists', 'Russian people of Ukrainian descent', 'Russian prisoners and detainees', 'Russian television talk show hosts', 'Russian writers of Ukrainian descent', 'Sharashka inmates', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Southern Federal University alumni', 'Soviet Army officers', 'Soviet Nobel laureates', 'Soviet dissidents', 'Soviet emigrants to Germany', 'Soviet emigrants to Switzerland', 'Soviet emigrants to the United States', 'Soviet expellees', 'Soviet historians', 'Soviet male writers', 'Soviet military personnel of World War II', 'Soviet novelists', 'Soviet prisoners and detainees', 'Soviet psychiatric abuse whistleblowers', 'Soviet rehabilitations', 'Soviet short story writers', 'Soviet whistleblowers', 'Stalinism-era scholars and writers', 'State Prize of the Russian Federation laureates', 'Stateless people', 'Templeton Prize laureates', 'Use dmy dates from October 2021', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from February 2020', 'World War II poets']",127,9
587,Norman Ernest Borlaug,The Nobel Peace Prize,1970,1914,USA,2009, 1/1 ,, “for having given a well-founded hope - the green revolution” ,,,,,"Norman Ernest Borlaug (; March 25, 1914 – September 12, 2009) was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.
Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937 and PhD in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position with CIMMYT in Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties. During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those nations.Borlaug was often called ""the father of the Green Revolution"", and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation. According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 article ""Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity."" The article states that the ""form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths."" He was awarded the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.
Later in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food production in Asia and Africa.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug,75,"['1914 births', '2009 deaths', '20th-century American biologists', '21st-century American scientists', '21st-century biologists', 'All articles with failed verification', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'American Lutherans', 'American Nobel laureates', 'American agronomists', 'American biologists', 'American humanitarians', 'American people of Norwegian descent', 'Articles that may contain original research from May 2019', 'Articles using small message boxes', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with failed verification from May 2019', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from March 2020', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2019', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2009', 'Articles with unsourced statements from December 2015', 'Articles with unsourced statements from May 2010', 'CS1 maint', 'Civilian Conservation Corps people', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'Congressional Gold Medal recipients', 'Deaths from cancer in Texas', 'Deaths from lymphoma', 'Development specialists', 'Fellows of Bangladesh Academy of Sciences', 'Fellows of Pakistan Academy of Sciences', 'Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh', 'Foreign Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy', 'Foreign Members of the Royal Society', 'Foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering', 'Founding members of the World Cultural Council', 'Incomplete lists from May 2019', 'Members of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences', 'Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences', 'Members of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters', 'Members of the Polish Academy of Sciences', 'Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry', 'Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Mexican Academy of Sciences', 'National Medal of Science laureates', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People from Cresco, Iowa', 'People from Dallas', 'Plant breeding', 'Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients', 'Recipients of the Great Cross of the National Order of Scientific Merit (Brazil)', 'Recipients of the Padma Vibhushan in science & engineering', 'Rockefeller Foundation people', 'Scientists from Iowa', 'Scientists from Minnesota', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'TWAS fellows', 'University of Minnesota College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences alumni', 'Use mdy dates from March 2022', 'Vannevar Bush Award recipients', 'Webarchive template wayback links']",82,2

When awarding the prize in 1970, the Swedish Royal Academies stated that he ""has done more than any other contemporary economist to raise the level of scientific analysis in economic theory"". Economic historian Randall E. Parker has called him the ""Father of Modern Economics"", and The New York Times considers him to be the ""foremost academic economist of the 20th century"".Samuelson was likely the most influential economist of the latter half of the 20th century. In 1996, when he was awarded the National Medal of Science, considered to be America's top science-honor, President Bill Clinton commended Samuelson for his ""fundamental contributions to economic science"" for over 60 years. Samuelson considered mathematics to be the ""natural language"" for economists and contributed significantly to the mathematical foundations of economics with his book Foundations of Economic Analysis. He was author of the best-selling economics textbook of all time: Economics: An Introductory Analysis, first published in 1948. It was the second American textbook that attempted to explain the principles of Keynesian economics. It is now in its 19th edition, having sold nearly 4 million copies in 40 languages. James Poterba, former head of MIT's Department of Economics, noted that by his book, Samuelson ""leaves an immense legacy, as a researcher and a teacher, as one of the giants on whose shoulders every contemporary economist stands"".He entered the University of Chicago at age 16, during the depths of the Great Depression, and received his PhD in economics from Harvard. After graduating, he became an assistant professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) when he was 25 years of age and a full professor at age 32. In 1966, he was named Institute Professor, MIT's highest faculty honor. He spent his career at MIT, where he was instrumental in turning its Department of Economics into a world-renowned institution by attracting other noted economists to join the faculty, including later winners of the Nobel Prize Robert Solow (Samuelson's protégé), Robert C. Merton (one of his doctoral students), Franco Modigliani, Joseph Stiglitz, and Paul Krugman.
He served as an advisor to President John F. Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson, and was a consultant to the United States Treasury, the Bureau of the Budget and the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Samuelson wrote a weekly column for Newsweek magazine along with Chicago School economist Milton Friedman, where they represented opposing sides: Samuelson, as a self described ""Cafeteria Keynesian"", claimed taking the Keynesian perspective but only accepting what he felt was good in it. By contrast, Friedman represented the monetarist perspective. Together with Henry Wallich, their 1967 columns earned the magazine a Gerald Loeb Special Award in 1968.Samuelson worked in many theoretical fields, including: consumer theory; welfare economics; capital; finance, particularly the efficient-market hypothesis; public finance, particularly optimal allocation; international economics, particularly the Balassa–Samuelson effect and the Heckscher–Ohlin model; macroeconomics, particularly the overlapping generations model; and market economics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Samuelson,76,"['1915 births', '2009 deaths', '20th-century American economists', '20th-century American writers', '21st-century American economists', '21st-century American non-fiction writers', 'All articles with dead external links', 'American Nobel laureates', 'American people of Polish-Jewish descent', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with BNMM identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DBLP identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with Google Scholar identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with Internet Archive links', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MATHSN identifiers', 'Articles with MGP identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with ZBMATH identifiers', 'Articles with dead external links from November 2017', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with short description', 'Burials at Mount Auburn Cemetery', 'CS1 Swedish-language sources (sv)', 'CS1 errors', 'CS1 errors', 'CS1 errors', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 maint', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Corresponding Fellows of the British Academy', 'Economists from Indiana', 'Economists from Massachusetts', 'Fellows of the Econometric Society', 'Harvard University alumni', 'Hyde Park Academy High School alumni', 'Jewish American social scientists', 'Jewish American writers', 'Kennedy administration personnel', 'MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences faculty', 'Members of the American Philosophical Society', 'Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences', 'National Medal of Science laureates', 'Neo-Keynesian economists', 'Nobel laureates in Economics', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Pages with login required references or sources', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People from Belmont, Massachusetts', 'Presidents of the American Economic Association', 'Presidents of the Econometric Society', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Trade economists', 'University of Chicago alumni', 'Use mdy dates from September 2019', 'Writers from Gary, Indiana']",85,261

Gell-Mann introduced the concept of quarks as the fundamental building blocks of the strongly interacting particles, and the renormalization group
as a foundational element of quantum field theory and statistical mechanics. 
He played key roles in developing the concept of chirality in the theory of the weak interactions and 
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the strong interactions,  which controls the physics of the light mesons. In the 1970s he was a co-inventor of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) which explains the confinement of quarks in mesons and baryons and forms a large part of the Standard Model of elementary particles and forces.
Gell-Mann received the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work regarding elementary particles. He was the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus at the California Institute of Technology, a distinguished fellow and one of the co-founders of the Santa Fe Institute, a professor of physics at the University of New Mexico, and the Presidential Professor of Physics and Medicine at the University of Southern California.

He was born in Owosso, Michigan and received his B.S. in chemistry at Michigan State University in 1930 and his Ph.D. in bacteriology in 1934, taking a position shortly thereafter at the Department of Bacteriology at Washington University in St. Louis.Around 1943, Hershey met bacteriophage researchers Max Delbrück, then at Vanderbilt University, and Salvador Luria at Columbia University.  Hershey became part of their informal network of biologists, known as the Phage group. 
Hershey began performing experiments with bacteriophages with Italian-American Prima Luria, German Max Delbrück, and observed that when two different strains of bacteriophage have infected the same bacteria, the two viruses may exchange genetic information.In 1950 Hershey married his research partner Martha Chase at Laurel Hollow, New York and joined the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Genetics. There he and his wife Martha Chase performed the famous Hershey–Chase experiment in 1952. This experiment provided additional evidence that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material of life. Notable post-doctoral fellows in Hershey's lab include Anna Marie Skalka.Hershey became director of the Carnegie Institution (which later became Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) in 1962 and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969, shared with Salvador Luria and Max Delbrück for their discovery on the replication of viruses and their genetic structure.*Hershey officially retired in 1970, but lived on the grounds of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for the rest of his life. In 1971, he edited The Bacteriophage λ, an extensive volume on the subject, published by Cold Spring Harbor.In 1981, Hershey became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.Hershey had one child, Peter Manning Hershey (1956-1999) with his wife Harriet Davidson (1918-2000).  The family was active in the social network of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and regularly enjoyed the beach in season. Hershey was a Christian. Hershey died from congestive heart failure on 22 May 1997 at his home in Syosset, New York, at 88 years old. After Hershey died, another phage worker, Frank Stahl, wrote: ""The Phage Church, as we were sometimes called (see Phage group), was led by the Trinity of Delbrück, Luria, and Hershey.

His work became increasingly minimalist as his career progressed, involving more aesthetic and linguistic experimentation, with techniques of stream of consciousness repetition and self-reference. He is considered one of the last modernist writers, and one of the key figures in what Martin Esslin called the Theatre of the Absurd.A resident of Paris for most of his adult life, Beckett wrote in both French and English.

He coined the term econometrics in 1926 for utilising statistical methods to describe economic systems, as well as the terms microeconomics and macroeconomics in 1933, for describing individual and aggregate economic systems, respectively. He was the first to develop a statistically informed model of business cycles in 1933. Later work on the model together with Jan Tinbergen won the two the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969.Frisch became dr.philos. with a thesis on mathematics and statistics at the University of Oslo in 1926. After his doctoral thesis, he spent five years researching in the United States at the University of Minnesota and Yale University. After teaching briefly at Yale from 1930–31, he was offered a full professorship in economics, which he declined after pressures by colleagues to return to the University of Oslo. After returning to Oslo, Frisch was first appointed by the King-in-Council as Professor of Economics and Statistics at the Faculty of Law, University of Oslo (then the Royal Frederick University) in 1931, before becoming leader of the newly founded Institute of Economics at the University of Oslo in 1932. He remained at the University of Oslo until his retirement in 1965.
Frisch was one of the founders of the Econometric Society in 1930, and edited the journal Econometrica for its first 21 years.Ragnar Frisch has given name to the Frisch Medal, which is awarded every year by the Econometric Society for the best paper in econometrics published in the last five years, as well as the Frisch-centre for Applied Economic Analysis at the University of Oslo.

In 2007 the American Journal of Physics commented, ""Luis Alvarez was one of the most brilliant and productive experimental physicists of the twentieth century.""After receiving his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1936, Alvarez went to work for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed. He produced tritium using the cyclotron and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with Felix Bloch, he measured the magnetic moment of the neutron.
In 1940, Alvarez joined the MIT Radiation Laboratory, where he contributed to a number of World War II radar projects, from early improvements to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has played a major role in aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.
After the war Alvarez was involved in the design of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He was involved in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers.

He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 (with Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall Warren Nirenberg) for describing the structure of alanine transfer RNA, linking DNA and protein synthesis.
Holley was born in Urbana, Illinois, and graduated from Urbana High School in 1938. He went on to study chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating in 1942 and commencing his PhD studies in organic chemistry at Cornell University. During World War II Holley spent two years working under Professor Vincent du Vigneaud at Cornell University Medical College, where he was involved in the first chemical synthesis of penicillin. Holley completed his PhD studies in 1947.Following his graduate studies Holley remained associated with Cornell. He became an assistant professor of organic chemistry in 1948, and was appointed as professor of biochemistry in 1962. He began his research on RNA after spending a year's sabbatical (1955–1956) studying with James F. Bonner at the California Institute of Technology.
Holley's research on RNA focused first on isolating transfer RNA (tRNA), and later on determining the sequence and structure of alanine tRNA, the molecule that incorporates the amino acid alanine into proteins. Holley's team of researchers determined the tRNA's structure by using two  ribonucleases to split the tRNA molecule into pieces. Each enzyme split the molecule at location points for specific nucleotides. By a process of ""puzzling out"" the structure of the pieces split by the two different enzymes, then comparing the pieces from both enzyme splits, the team eventually determined the entire structure of the molecule. The group of researchers include Elizabeth Beach Keller, who developed the cloverleaf model that describes transfer RNA, during the course of the research.The structure was completed in 1964, and was a key discovery in explaining the synthesis of proteins from messenger RNA. It was also the first nucleotide sequence of a ribonucleic acid ever determined. Holley was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 for this discovery, and Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall W. Nirenberg were also awarded the prize that year for contributions to the understanding of protein synthesis.
Using the Holley team's method, other scientists determined the structures of the remaining tRNA's. A few years later the method was modified to help track the sequence of nucleotides in various bacterial, plant, and human viruses.
In 1968 Holley became a resident fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California.
According to the New York Times obituary, ""He was an avid outdoorsman and an amateur sculptor of bronze.""

For most of his career, Bethe was a professor at Cornell University.During World War II, he was head of the Theoretical Division at the secret Los Alamos laboratory that developed the first atomic bombs. There he played a key role in calculating the critical mass of the weapons and developing the theory behind the implosion method used in both the Trinity test and the ""Fat Man"" weapon dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945.
After the war, Bethe also played an important role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, although he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).
His scientific research never ceased and he was publishing papers well into his nineties, making him one of the few scientists to have published at least one major paper in his field during every decade of his career, which in Bethe's case spanned nearly seventy years.

Winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1967, his work helped bring attention to the importance of indigenous cultures, especially those of his native Guatemala.
Asturias was born and raised in Guatemala though he lived a significant part of his adult life abroad. He first lived in Paris in the 1920s where he studied ethnology. Some scholars view him as the first Latin American novelist to show how the study of anthropology and linguistics could affect the writing of literature. While in Paris, Asturias also associated with the Surrealist movement, and he is credited with introducing many features of modernist style into Latin American letters. In this way, he is an important precursor of the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s.
One of Asturias' most famous novels, El Señor Presidente, describes life under a ruthless dictator. The novel influenced later Latin American novelists in its mixture of realism and fantasy. Asturias' very public opposition to dictatorial rule led to him spending much of his later life in exile, both in South America and in Europe. The book that is sometimes described as his masterpiece, Hombres de maíz (Men of Maize), is a defense of Mayan culture and customs. Asturias combined his extensive knowledge of Mayan beliefs with his political convictions, channeling them into a life of commitment and solidarity. His work is often identified with the social and moral aspirations of the Guatemalan people.
After decades of exile and marginalization, Asturias finally received broad recognition in the 1960s. In 1966, he won the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize. The following year he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming the second Latin American author to receive this honor (Gabriela Mistral had won it in 1945). Asturias spent his final years in Madrid, where he died at the age of 74. He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_%C3%81ngel_Asturias,83,"['1899 births', '1974 deaths', '20th-century Guatemalan poets', '20th-century Guatemalan writers', '20th-century journalists', '20th-century male writers', '20th-century short story writers', 'All articles with dead external links', 'Ambassadors of Guatemala to Argentina', 'Ambassadors of Guatemala to El Salvador', 'Ambassadors of Guatemala to France', 'Ambassadors of Guatemala to Mexico', 'Articles with ADK identifiers', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Spanish-language sources (es)', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with dead external links from January 2018', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with short description', 'Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 maint', 'Guatemalan Nobel laureates', 'Guatemalan diplomats', 'Guatemalan journalists', 'Guatemalan male poets', 'Guatemalan male short story writers', 'Guatemalan novelists', 'Guatemalan short story writers', 'Harv and Sfn no-target errors', 'Magic realism writers', 'Male journalists', 'Male novelists', 'Members of the Congress of Guatemala', 'Mestizo writers', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Recipients of the Lenin Peace Prize', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala alumni', 'University of Paris alumni', 'Use dmy dates from January 2023', 'Writers from Guatemala City']",72,54

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.
Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time.He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.
Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

From their own work and the work of others, they came up with a model for how the levels of some proteins in a cell are controlled. In their model, the manufacture of proteins, such as the ones encoded within the lac (lactose) operon, is prevented when a repressor, encoded by a regulatory gene, binds to its operator, a specific site in the DNA sequence that is close to the genes encoding the proteins. (It is now known that a repressor bound to an operator physically blocks RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, the site where transcription of the adjacent genes begins.)
Study of the control of expression of genes in the lac operon provided the first example of a system for the regulation of transcription.

636,Martin Luther King Jr.,The Nobel Peace Prize,1964,1929,USA,1968, 1/1 ,, “for his non-violent struggle for civil rights for the Afro-American population” ,,,,,"Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination on April 4, 1968. A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through nonviolence and civil disobedience. Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted, nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws and other forms of discrimination in the United States.
King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights. He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.
The SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently. King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the federal holiday was first observed in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and King County in Washington was rededicated for him.

P."" Wigner (Hungarian: Wigner Jenő Pál, pronounced [ˈviɡnɛr ˈjɛnøː ˈpaːl]; November 17, 1902 – January 1, 1995) was a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist who also contributed to mathematical physics. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 ""for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles"".A graduate of the Technical University of Berlin, Wigner worked as an assistant to Karl Weissenberg and Richard Becker at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and David Hilbert at the University of Göttingen. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into physics, particularly the theory of symmetry in physics. Along the way he performed ground-breaking work in pure mathematics, in which he authored a number of mathematical theorems. In particular, Wigner's theorem is a cornerstone in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. He is also known for his research into the structure of the atomic nucleus. In 1930, Princeton University recruited Wigner, along with John von Neumann, and he moved to the United States, where he obtained citizenship in 1937.
Wigner participated in a meeting with Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein that resulted in the Einstein–Szilard letter, which prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to initiate the Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs. Wigner was afraid that the German nuclear weapon project would develop an atomic bomb first. During the Manhattan Project, he led a team whose task was to design nuclear reactors to convert uranium into weapons grade plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. Wigner was disappointed that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, not just their construction.

She was the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics, the first being Marie Curie.  In 1986, the Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award for early-career women physicists was established in her honor.
A graduate of the University of Göttingen, Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctoral thesis on the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the laser in the 1960s later permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon absorption cross section is named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.
Maria Goeppert married chemist Joseph Edward Mayer and moved to the United States, where he was an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University. Strict rules against nepotism prevented Johns Hopkins University from taking her on as a faculty member, but she was given a job as an assistant and published a landmark paper on double beta decay in 1935. In 1937, she moved to Columbia University, where she took an unpaid position. During World War II, she worked for the Manhattan Project at Columbia on isotope separation, and with Edward Teller at the Los Alamos Laboratory on the development of thermonuclear weapons.
After the war, Goeppert Mayer became a voluntary associate professor of physics at the University of Chicago (where her husband and Teller worked) and a senior physicist at the university-run Argonne National Laboratory. She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with J. Hans D. Jensen and Eugene Wigner.

After the war he resumed research at the University of Cambridge, where he developed interference microscopy that would be suitable for studying muscle fibres.
In 1952, he was joined by a German physiologist Rolf Niedergerke. Together they discovered in 1954 the mechanism of muscle contraction, popularly called the ""sliding filament theory"", which is the foundation of our modern understanding of muscle mechanics. In 1960 he became head of the Department of Physiology at University College London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955, and President in 1980.

In 1953, he co-authored with Francis Crick the academic paper proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material"". 
Watson earned degrees at the University of Chicago (BS, 1947) and Indiana University (PhD, 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the University of Copenhagen with Herman Kalckar and Ole Maaløe, Watson worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the Harvard University Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology.
From 1968, Watson served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer, along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming that there is a genetic link between intelligence and race. In 2019, following the broadcast of a documentary in which Watson reiterated these views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him.
Watson has written many science books, including the textbook Molecular Biology of the Gene (1965) and his bestselling book The Double Helix (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the National Institutes of Health, helping to establish the Human Genome Project, which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson,84,"['1928 births', '20th-century American physicists', '20th-century American zoologists', '21st-century American physicists', '21st-century American zoologists', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'American atheists', 'American biophysicists', 'American expatriates in the United Kingdom', 'American former Christians', 'American geneticists', 'American male non-fiction writers', 'American molecular biologists', 'American people of English descent', 'American people of Irish descent', 'American people of Scottish descent', 'American science writers', 'American textbook writers', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Scopus identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with ZBMATH identifiers', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from October 2020', 'Biography with signature', 'CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt)', 'CS1 maint', 'Fellows of Clare College, Cambridge', 'Foreign Members of the Royal Society', 'Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences', 'Foreign Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences', 'Former Roman Catholics', 'Harvard University faculty', 'Hastings Center Fellows', 'Honorary Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire', 'Indiana University alumni', 'Interlanguage link template existing link', 'James Watson', 'Living people', 'Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization', 'Members of the Royal Irish Academy', 'Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences', 'National Medal of Science laureates', 'Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Pages containing links to subscription-only content', 'Pages using Sister project links with default search', 'Pages with non-numeric formatnum arguments', 'People appearing on C-SPAN', 'People from Cold Spring Harbor, New York', 'Phage workers', 'Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients', 'Proponents of scientific racism', 'Race and intelligence controversy', 'Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research', 'Recipients of the Copley Medal', 'Scientists from Chicago', 'Scientists from New York (state)', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'University of Chicago alumni', 'Use mdy dates from January 2019', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia pending changes protected pages', 'Writers from Chicago', 'Writers from New York (state)']",94,9

He is known for his work at King's College London on the structure of DNA.
Wilkins' work on DNA falls into two distinct phases. The first was in 1948–1950, when his initial studies produced the first clear X-ray images of DNA, which he presented at a conference in Naples in 1951 attended by James Watson. During the second phase, 1951–52, Wilkins produced clear ""B form"" ""X"" shaped images from squid sperm, images he sent to James Watson and Francis Crick, causing Watson to write ""Wilkins... has obtained extremely excellent X-ray diffraction photographs"" [of DNA].In 1953, Wilkins' group coordinator Sir John Randall instructed Raymond Gosling to hand over to Wilkins a high-quality image of ""B"" form DNA (Photo 51), which Gosling had made in 1952, after which his supervisor Rosalind Franklin ""put it aside"" as she was leaving King's College London. Wilkins showed it to Watson. This image, along with the knowledge that Linus Pauling had proposed an incorrect structure of DNA, ""mobilised"" Watson and Crick to restart model building. With additional information from research reports of Wilkins and Franklin, obtained via Max Perutz, Watson and Crick correctly described the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953.
Wilkins continued to test, verify, and make significant corrections to the Watson–Crick DNA model and to study the structure of RNA.

He published more than 1,200 papers and books, of which about 850 dealt with scientific topics. New Scientist called him one of the 20 greatest scientists of all time, and as of 2000, he was rated the 16th most important scientist in history. For his scientific work, Pauling was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954. For his peace activism, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962. He is one of five people to have won more than one Nobel Prize (the others being Marie Curie, John Bardeen, Frederick Sanger and Karl Barry Sharpless). Of these, he is the only person to have been awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes, and one of two people to be awarded Nobel Prizes in different fields, the other being Marie Curie.Pauling was one of the founders of the fields of quantum chemistry and molecular biology. His contributions to the theory of the chemical bond include the concept of orbital hybridisation and the first accurate scale of electronegativities of the elements. Pauling also worked on the structures of biological molecules, and showed the importance of the alpha helix and beta sheet in protein secondary structure. Pauling's approach combined methods and results from X-ray crystallography, molecular model building, and quantum chemistry. His discoveries inspired the work of Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins on the structure of DNA, which in turn made it possible for geneticists to crack the DNA code of all organisms.In his later years, he promoted nuclear disarmament, as well as orthomolecular medicine, megavitamin therapy, and dietary supplements, especially ascorbic acid (commonly known as Vitamin C).

Because of the structure of the cochlea and the basilar membrane, different frequencies of sound cause the maximum amplitudes of the waves to occur at different places on the basilar membrane along the coil of the cochlea. High frequencies cause more vibration at the base of the cochlea while low frequencies create more vibration at the apex.He concluded that his observations showed how different sound wave frequencies are locally dispersed before exciting different nerve fibers that lead from the cochlea to the brain.

660,Ivo Andric,The Nobel Prize in Literature,1961,1892,Bosnia (now Bosnia and Herzegovina),1975, 1/1 ,, “for the epic force with which he has traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from the history of his country” ,,,,,"Ivo Andrić (Serbian Cyrillic: Иво Андрић, pronounced [ǐːʋo ǎːndritɕ]; born Ivan Andrić; 9 October 1892 – 13 March 1975) was a Yugoslav novelist, poet and short story writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. His writings dealt mainly with life in his native Bosnia under Ottoman rule.
Born in Travnik in Austria-Hungary, modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, Andrić attended high school in Sarajevo, where he became an active member of several South Slav national youth organizations. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, Andrić was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian police, who suspected his involvement in the plot. As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him, he spent much of the war under house arrest, only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917. After the war, he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in Zagreb and Graz, eventually attaining his PhD. in Graz in 1924. He worked in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1920 to 1923 and again from 1924 to 1941. In 1939, he became Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany, but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the German-led invasion of his country. Shortly after the invasion, Andrić returned to German-occupied Belgrade. He lived quietly in a friend's apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions likened by some biographers to house arrest, and wrote some of his most important works, including Na Drini ćuprija (The Bridge on the Drina).
Following the war, Andrić was named to a number of ceremonial posts in Yugoslavia, which had since come under communist rule. In 1961, the Nobel Committee awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature, selecting him over writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert Frost, John Steinbeck and E. M. Forster. The Committee cited ""the epic force with which he ... traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country's history"". Afterwards, Andrić's works found an international audience and were translated into a number of languages. In subsequent years, he received a number of awards in his native country. Andrić's health declined substantially in late 1974 and he died in Belgrade the following March.
In the years following Andrić's death, the Belgrade apartment where he spent much of World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former Yugoslavia also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is named after Andrić. As Yugoslavia's only Nobel Prize-winning writer, Andrić was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the breakup of Yugoslavia, his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti-Muslim bias. In Croatia, his works were blacklisted following Yugoslavia's dissolution, but were rehabilitated by the literary community in 1999. He is highly regarded in Serbia for his contributions to Serbian literature.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Andri%C4%87,89,"['1892 births', '1975 deaths', '20th-century male writers', '20th-century novelists', 'Ambassadors of Yugoslavia to Germany', 'Articles containing Serbian-language text', 'Articles containing Serbo-Croatian-language text', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina writers', 'Burials at Belgrade New Cemetery', 'CS1 Croatian-language sources (hr)', 'CS1 Serbian-language sources (sr)', 'CS1 Serbo-Croatian-language sources (sh)', 'Croat writers from Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Good articles', 'Grand Officers of the Legion of Honour', 'History of Travnik', 'Interlanguage link template forcing interwiki links', 'Ivo Andrić', 'Jagiellonian University alumni', 'Members of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts', 'Nobel laureates from Austria-Hungary', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata', 'Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch', 'People from Travnik', 'People from the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Recipients of the Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour', 'Serbian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina descent', 'Serbian people of Croatian descent', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Use dmy dates from October 2022', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages', 'Writers from Belgrade', 'Yugoslav Nobel laureates', 'Yugoslav writers', 'Yugoslavism']",70,41

As of 2023, he remains the youngest person to have held the post, having been only 47 years old when he was appointed. He was a son of Hjalmar Hammarskjöld, who served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1914 to 1917.
Hammarskjöld's tenure was characterized by efforts to strengthen the newly formed UN both internally and externally. He led initiatives to improve morale and organisational efficiency while seeking to make the UN more responsive to global issues. He presided over the creation of the first UN peacekeeping forces in Egypt and the Congo and personally intervened to defuse or resolve diplomatic crises. Hammarskjöld's second term was cut short when he died in a plane crash while en route to cease-fire negotiations during the Congo Crisis.
Hammarskjöld was and remains well regarded internationally as a capable diplomat and administrator, and his efforts to resolve various global crises led to him being the only posthumous recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. He is considered one of the two best UN secretaries-general, along with his successor U Thant, and his appointment has been hailed as one of the most notable successes for the organization.

For his contributions to the team that developed this process, Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1960.
A 1931 chemistry graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, from which he received his doctorate in 1933, he studied radioactive elements and developed sensitive Geiger counters to measure weak natural and artificial radioactivity. During World War II he worked in the Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, developing the gaseous diffusion process for uranium enrichment.
After the war, Libby accepted a professorship at the University of Chicago's Institute for Nuclear Studies, where he developed the technique for dating organic compounds using carbon-14. He also discovered that tritium similarly could be used for dating water, and therefore wine. In 1950, he became a member of the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He was appointed a commissioner in 1954, becoming its sole scientist. He sided with Edward Teller on pursuing a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, participated in the Atoms for Peace program, and defended the administration's atmospheric nuclear testing.

He won a Nobel Prize in 1960 for predicting acquired immune tolerance and he developed the theory of clonal selection.
Burnet received his Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Melbourne in 1924, and his PhD from the University of London in 1928. He went on to conduct pioneering research in microbiology and immunology at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, and served as director of the Institute from 1944 to 1965. From 1965 until his retirement in 1978, Burnet worked at the University of Melbourne. Throughout his career he played an active role in the development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the Australian Academy of Science (AAS), and served as its president from 1965 to 1969.
Burnet's major achievements in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of Q-fever and psittacosis; developing assays for the isolation, culture and detection of influenza virus; describing the recombination of influenza strains; demonstrating that the myxomatosis virus does not cause disease in humans. Modern methods for producing influenza vaccines are still based on Burnet's work improving virus growing processes in hen's eggs.
For his contributions to Australian science, Burnet was made the first Australian of the Year in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the Order of Australia.

667,Albert John Lutuli,The Nobel Peace Prize,1960,1898,Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe),1967, 1/1 ,, “for his non-violent struggle against apartheid” ,,,,,"Albert John Luthuli (c. 1898 – 21 July 1967) was a South African anti-apartheid activist, traditional leader, and politician who served as the President-General of the African National Congress from 1952 until his death in 1967.
Luthuli was born to a Zulu family in 1898 at a Seventh-day Adventist mission in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He returned to his family's ancestral home of Groutville in 1908 to attend school under the care of his uncle. After graduating from high school with a teaching degree, Luthuli became principal of a small school in Natal where he was the sole teacher. Luthuli's teaching was recognised by the government, and he was offered a bursary to study for the Higher Teacher's Diploma at Adams College. After the completion of his studies in 1922, he accepted a teaching position at Adams College where he was one of the first African teachers. In 1928, he became the secretary of the Natal Native Teachers' Association, then its president in 1933.
Luthuli's entry into South African politics and the anti-apartheid movement started in 1935 when he was elected chief of the Umvoti River Reserve in Groutville. As chief, he was exposed to the injustices facing many Africans due to the South African government's increasingly segregationist policies. This segregation would later evolve into apartheid, a form of institutionalized racial segregation following the National Party's election victory in 1948. Luthuli joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1944 and was elected the provincial president of the Natal branch in 1951. A year later in 1952, Luthuli led the Defiance Campaign to protest the pass laws and other laws of apartheid. As a result, the government removed him from his chief position as he refused to choose between being a member of the ANC or a chief at Groutville. In the same year, he was elected President-General of the ANC. After the Sharpeville massacre, where sixty-nine Africans were killed, leaders within the ANC such as Nelson Mandela believed the organisation should take up armed resistance against the government. Luthuli was against the use of violence, but as time passed, he gradually accepted it; however, he stayed committed to nonviolence on a personal level. Following four banning orders, the imprisonment and exile of his political allies, and the banning of the ANC, Luthuli's power as President-General gradually waned. The subsequent creation of uMkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's paramilitary wing, marked the anti-apartheid movement's shift from nonviolence to an armed struggle.
Inspired by his Christian faith and the nonviolent methods used by Gandhi, Luthuli was praised for his dedication to nonviolent resistance against apartheid as well as his vision of a non-racial South African society. In 1961, Luthuli was awarded the 1960 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in leading the nonviolent anti-apartheid movement. Luthuli's supporters brand him as a global icon of peace similar to Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr, the latter of whom claimed to be a follower and admirer of Luthuli. He formed multi-racial alliances with the South African Indian Congress and the white Congress of Democrats, frequently drawing a backlash from Africanists in the ANC. The Africanist bloc believed that Africans should not ally themselves with other races, since Africans were the most disadvantaged race under apartheid. This schism led to the creation of the Pan-Africanist Congress led by Robert Sobukwe.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Luthuli,57,"['1898 births', '1967 deaths', 'All Wikipedia articles written in South African English', 'Anti-apartheid activists', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'Good articles', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nonviolence advocates', 'People acquitted of treason', 'Presidents of the African National Congress', 'Railway accident deaths in South Africa', 'Rectors of the University of Glasgow', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'South African Christians', 'South African Congregationalists', 'South African Nobel laureates', 'South African autobiographers', 'Use South African English from August 2012', 'Use dmy dates from April 2023', 'Zulu people']",38,2

Born in Tivoli, near Rome, Segrè studied engineering at the University of Rome La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927. Segrè was appointed assistant professor of physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo. After a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, he was sent a molybdenum strip from the laboratory's cyclotron accelerator in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. Using careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segrè was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature.
In 1938, Benito Mussolini's fascist government passed antisemitic laws barring Jews from university positions. As a Jew, Segrè was rendered an indefinite émigré. At the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence offered him a job as a research assistant. There, Segrè helped discover the element astatine and the isotope plutonium-239, which was later used to make the Fat Man nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki. From 1943 to 1946 he worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory as a group leader for the Manhattan Project. He found in April 1944 that Thin Man, the proposed plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon, would not work due to the presence of plutonium-240 impurities. In 1944, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. On his return to Berkeley in 1946, he became a professor of physics and of history of science, serving until 1972. Segrè and Owen Chamberlain co-headed a research group at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory that discovered the antiproton, for which the two shared the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Segrè was an active photographer who took many pictures documenting events and people in the history of modern science, which were donated to the American Institute of Physics after his death.

After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active; he was part of the left that opposed Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union because of their totalitarianism. Camus was a moralist and leaned towards anarcho-syndicalism. He was part of many organisations seeking European integration. During the Algerian War (1954–1962), he kept a neutral stance, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that was rejected by most parties.

Born in Newtonbrook, Ontario (now part of Toronto), Pearson pursued a career in the Department of External Affairs. He served as Canadian ambassador to the United States from 1944 to 1946 and secretary of state for external affairs from 1948 to 1957 under Liberal Prime Ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent. He narrowly lost the bid to become secretary-general of the United Nations in 1953. However, he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for organizing the United Nations Emergency Force to resolve the Suez Canal Crisis, which earned him attention worldwide. After the Liberals' defeat in the 1957 federal election, Pearson easily won the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1958. Pearson suffered two consecutive defeats by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1958 and 1962, only to successfully challenge him for a third time in the 1963 federal election. Pearson would win re-election in 1965.
Pearson ran two back-to-back minority governments during his tenure, and the Liberals not having a majority in the House of Commons meant he needed support from the opposition parties. With that support, Pearson launched progressive policies such as universal health care, the Canada Student Loan Program, and the Canada Pension Plan. Pearson also introduced the Order of Canada and the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, and oversaw the creation of the Maple Leaf flag that was implemented in 1965. His government unified the Canadian Armed Forces and kept Canada out of the Vietnam War. In 1967, Canada became the first country in the world to implement a points-based immigration system. After half a decade in power, Pearson resigned as prime minister and retired from politics.
With his government programs and policies, together with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy, which included his role in ending the Suez Crisis, Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century and is ranked among the greatest Canadian prime ministers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson,69,"['1897 births', '1972 deaths', '20th-century Canadian historians', '20th-century Canadian memoirists', '20th-century Canadian politicians', 'Academic staff of Carleton University', 'Academic staff of the University of Toronto', 'All Wikipedia articles written in Canadian English', 'All articles with dead external links', ""Alumni of St John's College, Oxford"", 'Ambassadors of Canada to the United States', 'Articles using small message boxes', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2018', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 Serbian-language sources (sr)', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1', 'CS1', 'Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame inductees', 'Canadian Methodists', 'Canadian Nobel laureates', 'Canadian Officers of the Order of the British Empire', 'Canadian Secretaries of State for External Affairs', 'Canadian World War I pilots', 'Canadian ice hockey players', 'Canadian male non-fiction writers', 'Canadian members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom', 'Canadian military personnel of World War I', 'Canadian people of Anglo-Irish descent', 'Chancellors of Carleton University', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Companions of the Order of Canada', 'Deaths from cancer in Ontario', 'Deaths from liver cancer', ""Fellows of St John's College, Oxford"", 'Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'Incomplete lists from May 2018', 'Leaders of the Liberal Party of Canada', 'Leaders of the Opposition (Canada)', 'Lester B.

In September, he began to study medicine at the Karolinska Institute and in 1924 he graduated as a Bachelor of Medicine. He then spent three months studying bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris under Professor Albert Calmette. In 1930 he obtained his M.D. degree with a theory on the lipids of the blood plasma, and was appointed professor in physiological chemistry at the Karolinska Institute.
Theorell, who dedicated his entire career to enzyme research, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1955 for discovering oxidoreductase enzymes and their effects. His contribution also consisted of the theory of the toxic effects of sodium fluoride on the cofactors of  crucial human enzymes. In 1936 he was appointed Head of the newly established Biochemical Department of the Nobel Medical Institute, the first researcher related to the Institute to be awarded a Nobel Prize.

He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his ""fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function"".Born entered the University of Göttingen in 1904, where he met the three renowned mathematicians Felix Klein, David Hilbert, and Hermann Minkowski. He wrote his PhD thesis on the subject of ""Stability of Elastica in a Plane and Space"", winning the university's Philosophy Faculty Prize. In 1905, he began researching special relativity with Minkowski, and subsequently wrote his habilitation thesis on the Thomson model of the atom. A chance meeting with Fritz Haber in Berlin in 1918 led to discussion of how an ionic compound is formed when a metal reacts with a halogen, which is today known as the Born–Haber cycle.
In World War I, after originally being placed as a radio operator, his specialist knowledge led to him being moved to research duties on sound ranging. In 1921 Born returned to Göttingen, arranging another chair for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck. Under Born Göttingen became one of the world's foremost centres for physics. In 1925 Born and Werner Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. The following year, he formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. His influence extended far beyond his own research. Max Delbrück, Siegfried Flügge, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf all received their PhD degrees under Born at Göttingen, and his assistants included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Léon Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner.
In January 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, and Born, who was Jewish, was suspended from his professorship at the University of Göttingen. He emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he took a job at St John's College, Cambridge, and wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, as well as Atomic Physics, which soon became a standard textbook. In October 1936, he became the Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, where, working with German-born assistants E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, he continued his research into physics. Born became a naturalised British subject on 31 August 1939, one day before World War II broke out in Europe. He remained in Edinburgh until 1952.

In 1913, he joined the newly created Laboratory for Radioactivity at the Reich Physical and Technical Institute (PTR), where he remained until 1930, the latter few years as the director of the laboratory. He served in the military during World War I from 1914, and he was a prisoner of war of the Russians, returning to Germany in 1920. Upon his return to the laboratory, he developed and applied coincidence methods to the study of nuclear reactions, the Compton effect, cosmic rays, and the wave–particle duality of radiation, for which he would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954.
In 1930 he became a full professor and director of the physics department at the University of Giessen. In 1932, he became director of the Physical and Radiological Institute at the University of Heidelberg. He was driven out of this position by elements of the deutsche Physik movement. To preclude his emigration from Germany, he was appointed director of the Physics Institute of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research (KWImF) in Heidelberg. There, he built the first operational cyclotron in Germany. Furthermore, he became a principal in the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club), which was started in 1939 under the supervision of the Army Ordnance Office.
In 1946, in addition to his directorship of the Physics Institute at the KWImf, he was reinstated as a professor at the University of Heidelberg. From 1956 to 1957, he was a member of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in Germany.
In the year after Bothe's death, his Physics Institute at the KWImF was elevated to the status of a new institute under the Max Planck Society and it then became the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics.

He published more than 1,200 papers and books, of which about 850 dealt with scientific topics. New Scientist called him one of the 20 greatest scientists of all time, and as of 2000, he was rated the 16th most important scientist in history. For his scientific work, Pauling was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954. For his peace activism, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962. He is one of five people to have won more than one Nobel Prize (the others being Marie Curie, John Bardeen, Frederick Sanger and Karl Barry Sharpless). Of these, he is the only person to have been awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes, and one of two people to be awarded Nobel Prizes in different fields, the other being Marie Curie.Pauling was one of the founders of the fields of quantum chemistry and molecular biology. His contributions to the theory of the chemical bond include the concept of orbital hybridisation and the first accurate scale of electronegativities of the elements. Pauling also worked on the structures of biological molecules, and showed the importance of the alpha helix and beta sheet in protein secondary structure. Pauling's approach combined methods and results from X-ray crystallography, molecular model building, and quantum chemistry. His discoveries inspired the work of Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins on the structure of DNA, which in turn made it possible for geneticists to crack the DNA code of all organisms.In his later years, he promoted nuclear disarmament, as well as orthomolecular medicine, megavitamin therapy, and dietary supplements, especially ascorbic acid (commonly known as Vitamin C). None of his ideas concerning the medical usefulness of large doses of vitamins have gained much acceptance in the mainstream scientific community.

710,Ernest Miller Hemingway,The Nobel Prize in Literature,1954,1899,USA,1961, 1/1 ,," “for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style” ",,,,,"Ernest Miller Hemingway (; July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style—which included his iceberg theory—had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.
Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school, he was a reporter for a few months for The Kansas City Star before leaving for the Italian Front to enlist as an ambulance driver in World War I. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929).
In 1921, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of four wives. They moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s' ""Lost Generation"" expatriate community. Hemingway's debut novel The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926. He divorced Richardson in 1927, and married Pauline Pfeiffer. They divorced after he returned from the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), which he covered as a journalist and which was the basis for his novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940. He and Gellhorn separated after he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II. Hemingway was present with Allied troops as a journalist at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris.

He was a pioneer scientist in the study of cellular respiration, a biochemical process in living cells that extracts energy from food and oxygen and makes it available to drive the processes of life. He is best known for his discoveries of two important sequences of chemical reactions that take place in the cells of nearly all organisms, including humans, other than anaerobic microorganisms, namely the citric acid cycle and the urea cycle. The former, often eponymously known as the ""Krebs cycle"", is the sequence of metabolic reactions that allows cells of oxygen-respiring organisms to obtain far more ATP from the food they consume than anaerobic processes such as glycolysis can supply; and its discovery earned Krebs a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953. With Hans Kornberg, he also discovered the glyoxylate cycle, a slight variation of the citric acid cycle found in plants, bacteria, protists, and fungi.

716,Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill,The Nobel Prize in Literature,1953,1874,United Kingdom,1965, 1/1 ,, “for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values” ,,,,,"Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British statesman, soldier, and writer who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twice, from 1940 to 1945 during the Second World War, and again from 1951 to 1955. Apart from two years between 1922 and 1924, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five constituencies. Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist, he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party, which he led from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924.
Of mixed English and American parentage, Churchill was born in Oxfordshire to the wealthy Spencer aristocratic family. He joined the British Army in 1895 and saw action in British India, the Anglo-Sudan War, and the Second Boer War, later gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns. Elected a Conservative MP in 1900, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In H. H. Asquith's Liberal government, Churchill served as President of the Board of Trade and Home Secretary, championing prison reform and workers' social security. As First Lord of the Admiralty during the First World War, he oversaw the Gallipoli Campaign but, after it proved a disaster, he was demoted to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He resigned in November 1915 and joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front for six months. In 1917, he returned to government under David Lloyd George and served successively as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, and Secretary of State for the Colonies, overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and British foreign policy in the Middle East. After two years out of Parliament, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government, returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy.
Out of government during his so-called ""wilderness years"" in the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In May 1940, he became Prime Minister, succeeding Neville Chamberlain. Churchill formed a national government and oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers, resulting in victory in 1945. After the Conservatives' defeat in the 1945 general election, he became Leader of the Opposition. Amid the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union, he publicly warned of an ""iron curtain"" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Between his terms as Prime Minister, he wrote several books recounting his experience during the war. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953. He lost the 1950 election, but was returned to office in 1951. His second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, especially Anglo-American relations and preservation of what remained of the British Empire with India now no longer part of it. Domestically, his government emphasised housebuilding and completed the development of a nuclear weapon (begun by his predecessor). In declining health, Churchill resigned as Prime Minister in 1955, remaining an MP until 1964. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a state funeral.
Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in the UK and the rest of the Anglosphere. Although he has been criticised for some wartime events and for his imperialist views, Churchill is generally seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending liberal democracy against the spread of fascism. Historians often rank Churchill as the greatest prime minister in British history.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill,165,"['1874 births', '1965 deaths', '19th-century English writers',

717,George Catlett Marshall,The Nobel Peace Prize,1953,1880,USA,1959, 1/1 ,, “for proposing and supervising the plan for the economic recovery of Europe” ,,,,,"George Catlett Marshall Jr.  (December 31, 1880 – October 16, 1959) was an American army officer and statesman. He rose through the United States Army to become Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army under Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, then served as Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense under Truman. Winston Churchill lauded Marshall as the ""organizer of victory"" for his leadership of the Allied victory in World War II. After the war, he spent a frustrating year trying and failing to avoid the impending Chinese Civil War. As Secretary of State, Marshall advocated for a U.S. economic and political commitment to post-war European recovery, including the Marshall Plan that bore his name. In recognition of this work, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953, the only Army general ever to be so honored.Born in Pennsylvania, Marshall graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in 1901. Marshall received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in February 1902 and immediately went to the Philippines. He served in the United States and overseas in positions of increasing rank and responsibility, including platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War. He was the top-ranked of the five Honor Graduates of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907, and graduated first in his 1908 Army Staff College class. In 1916 Marshall was assigned as aide-de-camp to J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Western Department. After the nation entered World War I in 1917, Marshall served with Bell who commanded the Department of the East. He was assigned to the staff of the 1st Division; he assisted with the organization's mobilization and training in the United States, as well as planning of its combat operations in France. Subsequently, assigned to the staff of the American Expeditionary Forces headquarters, he was a key planner of American operations; including the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.
After the war, Marshall became an aide-de-camp to John J. Pershing, who was then the Army's Chief of Staff. Marshall later served on the Army staff, was the executive officer of the 15th Infantry Regiment in China, and was an instructor at the Army War College. In 1927, he became assistant commandant of the Army's Infantry School, where he modernized command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during World War II. In 1932 and 1933 he commanded the 8th Infantry Regiment and Fort Screven, Georgia. Marshall commanded 5th Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division and Vancouver Barracks from 1936 to 1938; he received promotion to brigadier general. During this command, Marshall was also responsible for 35 Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps in Oregon and Southern Washington. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division on the War Department staff; he later became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff. When Chief of Staff Malin Craig retired in 1939, Marshall assumed the role of Chief of Staff in an acting capacity before his appointment to the position, which he held until the war's end in 1945.As Chief of Staff, Marshall, working closely with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, and received promotion to five-star rank as General of the Army. Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific until the end of the war. In addition to accolades from Winston Churchill and other Allied leaders, Time magazine named Marshall its Man of the Year for 1943 and 1947. Marshall retired from active service in 1945, but remained on active duty, as required for holders of five-star rank. From December 15, 1945, to January 1947, Marshall served as a special envoy to China in an unsuccessful effort to negotiate a coalition government between the Nationalists of Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists of Mao Zedong.
As Secretary of State from 1947 to 1949, Marshall advocated rebuilding Europe, a program that became known as the Marshall Plan, and which led to his being awarded the 1953 Nobel Peace Prize. After resigning as Secretary of State, Marshall served as chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission and president of the American National Red Cross. As Secretary of Defense at the start of the Korean War, Marshall worked to restore the military's confidence and morale at the end of its post-World War II demobilization and then its initial buildup for combat in Korea and operations during the Cold War.

After service on the Western Front with the Royal Field Artillery during the Great War, Cockcroft studied electrical engineering at Manchester Municipal College of Technology whilst he was an apprentice at Metropolitan Vickers Trafford Park and was also a member of their research staff. He then won a scholarship to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he sat the tripos exam in June 1924, becoming a wrangler. Ernest Rutherford accepted Cockcroft as a research student at the Cavendish Laboratory, and Cockcroft completed his doctorate under Rutherford's supervision in 1928. With Ernest Walton and Mark Oliphant he built what became known as a Cockcroft–Walton generator. Cockcroft and Walton used this to perform the first artificial disintegration of an atomic nucleus, a feat popularly known as splitting the atom.
During the Second World War Cockcroft became Assistant Director of Scientific Research in the Ministry of Supply, working on radar. He was also a member of the committee formed to handle issues arising from the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which calculated that an atomic bomb could be technically feasible, and of the MAUD Committee which succeeded it. In 1940, as part of the Tizard Mission, he shared British technology with his counterparts in the United States. Later in the war, the fruits of the Tizard Mission came back to Britain in the form of the SCR-584 radar set and the proximity fuze, which were used to help defeat the V-1 flying bomb. In May 1944, he became director of the Montreal Laboratory, and oversaw the development of the ZEEP and NRX reactors, and the creation of the Chalk River Laboratories.
After the war Cockcroft became the director of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by the British Experimental Pile 0 (BEPO) in 1948. Harwell was involved in the design of the reactors and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. His insistence that the chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of the reactors ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.
From 1959 to 1967, he was the first Master of Churchill College, Cambridge.

Truman to Bill Clinton—on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial nuclear energy and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the Franck Report and contributed to the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the Eisenhower administration, he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President Ronald Reagan's National Commission on Excellence in Education, he was a key contributor to its 1983 report ""A Nation at Risk"".
Seaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He said about this naming, ""This is the greatest honor ever bestowed upon me--even better, I think, than winning the Nobel Prize. Future students of chemistry, in learning about the periodic table, may have reason to ask why the element was named for me, and thereby learn more about my work."" He also discovered more than 100 isotopes of transuranium elements and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the implosion-type atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.
After sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Edwin McMillan, he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other awards and honors. The list of things named after Seaborg ranges from the chemical element seaborgium to the asteroid 4856 Seaborg. He was a prolific author, penning numerous books and 500 journal articles, often in collaboration with others. He  was once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the person with the longest entry in Who's Who in America.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_T._Seaborg,73,"['1912 births', '1999 deaths', '20th-century American chemists', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'American Nobel laureates', 'American people of Swedish descent', 'American skeptics', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with Internet Archive links', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Leopoldina identifiers', 'Articles with MGP identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Scopus identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with WorldCat Entities identifiers', 'Articles with dead external links from August 2023', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from July 2022', 'Biography with signature', 'Chairmen of the United States Atomic Energy Commission', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'Discoverers of chemical elements', 'Enrico Fermi Award recipients', 'Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science', 'Fellows of the American Physical Society', 'Foreign Members of the Royal Society', 'Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences', 'Foreign Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences', 'Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts', 'Founding members of the World Cultural Council', 'Glenn T.

Among black Nobel laureates he is the first African American and first person of African descent to be awarded a Nobel Prize. He was involved in the formation and early administration of the United Nations, and played a major role in both the decolonization process and numerous UN peacekeeping operations.
Bunche served on the US delegation to both the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944 and United Nations Conference on International Organization in 1945 that drafted the UN charter. He then served on the American delegation to the first session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1946 and joined the UN as head of the Trusteeship Department, beginning a long series of troubleshooting roles and responsibilities related to decolonization. In 1948, Bunche became an acting mediator for the Middle East, negotiating an armistice between Egypt and Israel. For this success he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.
Bunche continued to serve at the UN, working on crises in the Sinai (1956), the Congo (1960), Yemen (1963), Cyprus (1964) and Bahrain in 1970, reporting directly to the UN Secretary-General. He chaired study groups dealing with water resources in the Middle East. In 1957, he was promoted to Under-Secretary-General for special political affairs, having prime responsibility for peacekeeping roles.

A Nobel laureate, Faulkner is one of the most celebrated writers of American literature and often is considered the greatest writer of Southern literature.
Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, and his family moved to Oxford, Mississippi, when he was a child. With the outbreak of World War I, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force but did not serve in combat. Returning to Oxford, he attended the University of Mississippi for three semesters before dropping out. He moved to New Orleans, where he wrote his first novel Soldiers' Pay (1925). He went back to Oxford and wrote Sartoris (1927), his first work set in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County. In 1929, he published The Sound and the Fury. The following year, he wrote As I Lay Dying. Later that decade, he wrote Light in August, Absalom, Absalom! and The Wild Palms. He also worked as a screenwriter, contributing to Howard Hawks's To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep; the former film, adapted from a novel by Ernest Hemingway, is the only film with contributions by two Nobel laureates.Faulkner's renown reached its peak upon the publication of Malcolm Cowley's The Portable Faulkner and his being awarded the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature for ""his powerful and unique contribution to the modern American novel."" He is the only Mississippi-born Nobel laureate. Two of his works, A Fable (1954) and The Reivers (1962), won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

He was awarded the 1947 Nobel Prize in Literature. Gide's career ranged from his beginnings in the symbolist movement, to criticising imperialism between the two World Wars. The author of more than fifty books, he was described in his obituary in The New York Times as ""France's greatest contemporary man of letters"" and ""judged the greatest French writer of this century by the literary cognoscenti.""Known for his fiction as well as his autobiographical works, Gide expressed the conflict and eventual reconciliation of the two sides of his personality (characterized by a Protestant austerity and a transgressive sexual adventurousness, respectively). He suggested that a strict and moralistic education had helped set these facets at odds. Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritanical constraints. He worked to achieve intellectual honesty.

Although Fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of penicillin, it was Florey and his team at the University of Oxford who made it into a useful and effective drug, ten years after Fleming had abandoned its development. They developed techniques for growing, purifying and manufacturing the drug, tested it for toxicity and efficacy on animals, and carried out the first clinical trials. In 1941, they used it to treat a police constable from Oxford. He started to recover, but subsequently died because Florey was unable, at that time, to make enough penicillin. Later trials in Britain, the United States and North Africa were highly successful.
A graduate of the University of Adelaide, Florey studied at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and in the United States on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1935, he became the director of the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford. He  assembled a multidisciplinary staff that could tackle major research projects. In addition to his work on penicillin, he researched many other subjects, most notably lysozyme, contraception and cephalosporins. He  was involved in the founding of the Australian National University in Canberra and the establishment of its John Curtin School of Medical Research, and he served as Chancellor of the Australian National University from 1965 until his death in 1968. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1941, and as its president from 1960 to 1965, he oversaw its move to new accommodations at Carlton House Terrace and the establishment of links with European organisations. In 1962, he became Provost of The Queen's College, Oxford.
Florey's discoveries are estimated to have saved over 80 million lives, and he is regarded by the Australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures. Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies said, ""In terms of world well-being, Florey was the most important man ever born in Australia.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Florey,60,"['1898 births', '1968 deaths', 'Academics of the University of Sheffield', 'All Wikipedia articles written in Australian English', 'Alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford', 'Articles with ADB identifiers', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Scopus identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Australian Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians', 'Australian Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons', 'Australian Fellows of the Royal Society', 'Australian Knights Bachelor', 'Australian Nobel laureates', 'Australian Rhodes Scholars', 'Australian agnostics', 'Australian life peers', 'Australian members of the Order of Merit', 'Australian pathologists', 'Australian people of English descent', 'Australian pharmacologists', 'Australian scientists', 'CS1', 'Chancellors of the Australian National University', 'Commanders of the Legion of Honour', 'Fellows of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge', 'Fellows of Lincoln College, Oxford', ""Fellows of The Queen's College, Oxford"", 'Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences', 'Good articles', 'Life peers created by Elizabeth II', 'Medal for Merit recipients', 'Members of the American Philosophical Society', 'Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', ""People educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide"", 'Presidents of the Royal Society', ""Provosts of The Queen's College, Oxford"", 'Recipients of the Copley Medal', 'Royal Medal winners', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'University of Adelaide Medical School alumni', 'Use Australian English from November 2011', 'Use dmy dates from July 2023', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB']",67,1

He was also one of the first scientists in the United States to work on the cavity magnetron, which is used in microwave radar and microwave ovens.
Born into a traditional Polish-Jewish family in Rymanów, Galicia, Rabi came to the United States as an infant and was raised in New York's Lower East Side. He entered Cornell University as an electrical engineering student in 1916, but soon switched to chemistry. Later, he became interested in physics. He continued his studies at Columbia University, where he was awarded his doctorate for a thesis on the magnetic susceptibility of certain crystals. In 1927, he headed for Europe, where he met and worked with many of the finest physicists of the time.
In 1929, Rabi returned to the United States, where Columbia offered him a faculty position. In collaboration with Gregory Breit, he developed the Breit–Rabi equation and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm the properties of the atomic nucleus. His techniques for using nuclear magnetic resonance to discern the magnetic moment and nuclear spin of atoms earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. Nuclear magnetic resonance became an important tool for nuclear physics and chemistry, and the subsequent development of magnetic resonance imaging from it has also made it important to the field of medicine.
During World War II he worked on radar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Radiation Laboratory (RadLab) and on the Manhattan Project. After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission, and was chairman from 1952 to 1956. He also served on the Science Advisory Committees (SACs) of the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, and was Science Advisor to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was involved with the establishment of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1946, and later, as United States delegate to UNESCO, with the creation  of CERN in 1952. When Columbia created the rank of university professor in 1964, Rabi was the first to receive that position. A special chair was named after him in 1985. He retired from teaching in 1967, but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus and Special Lecturer until his death.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidor_Isaac_Rabi,74,"['1898 births', '1988 deaths', '20th-century American physicists', '20th-century atheists', 'All Wikipedia articles written in American English', 'American Nobel laureates', 'American nuclear physicists', 'American people of Polish-Jewish descent', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with MATHSN identifiers', 'Articles with MGP identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with ZBMATH identifiers', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Atoms for Peace Award recipients', 'Austro-Hungarian Jews', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'Columbia University alumni', 'Columbia University faculty', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'Cornell University alumni', 'Emigrants from Austria-Hungary to the United States', 'Featured articles', 'Fellows of the American Physical Society', 'Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars', 'Jewish American atheists', 'Jewish American scientists', 'Jewish physicists', 'Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe)', 'Manhattan Project people', 'Medal for Merit recipients', 'Niels Bohr International Gold Medal recipients', 'Nobel laureates from Austria-Hungary', 'Nobel laureates in Physics', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Office of Science and Technology Policy officials', 'People associated with CERN', 'People from Brownsville, Brooklyn', 'People from Rymanów', 'People from the Lower East Side', 'People from the Upper West Side', 'Polish atheists', 'Presidents of the American Physical Society', 'Recipients of the Four Freedoms Award', ""Recipients of the King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom"", 'Recipients of the Legion of Honour', 'Scientists from New York City', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Spectroscopists', 'Theoretical physicists', 'Use American English from July 2022', 'Use mdy dates from July 2022', 'Vannevar Bush Award recipients', 'Yiddish-speaking people']",73,16
774,Otto Hahn,The Nobel Prize in Chemistry,1944,1879,Germany,1968, 1/1 ,"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut (now Max-Planck Institut) für Chemie, Berlin-Dahlem, Germany ", “for his discovery of the fission of heavy nuclei” ,,,,,"Otto Hahn (pronounced [ˈɔtoː ˈhaːn] (listen); 8 March 1879 – 28 July 1968) was a German chemist who was a pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry. He is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry and father of nuclear fission. Hahn and Lise Meitner discovered radioactive isotopes of radium, thorium, protactinium and uranium. He also discovered the phenomena of atomic recoil and nuclear isomerism, and pioneered rubidium–strontium dating. In 1938, Hahn, Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission, for which Hahn received the 1944 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Nuclear fission was the basis for nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.
A graduate of the University of Marburg, which awarded him a doctorate in 1901, Hahn studied under Sir William Ramsay at University College London and at McGill University in Montreal under Ernest Rutherford, where he discovered several new radioactive isotopes. He returned to Germany in 1906; Emil Fischer placed a former woodworking shop in the basement of the Chemical Institute at the University of Berlin at his disposal to use as a laboratory. Hahn completed his habilitation in the spring of 1907 and became a Privatdozent. In 1912, he became head of the Radioactivity Department of the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry. Working with the Austrian physicist Lise Meitner in the building that now bears their names, he made a series of groundbreaking discoveries, culminating with her isolation of the longest-lived isotope of protactinium in 1918.
During World War I he served with a Landwehr regiment on the Western Front, and with the chemical warfare unit headed by Fritz Haber on the Western, Eastern and Italian fronts, earning the Iron Cross (2nd Class) for his part in the First Battle of Ypres. After the war he became the head of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, while remaining in charge of his own department. Between 1934 and 1938, he worked with Strassmann and Meitner on the study of isotopes created through the neutron bombardment of uranium and thorium, which led to the discovery of nuclear fission. He was an opponent of national socialism and the persecution of Jews by the Nazi Party that caused the removal of many of his colleagues, including Meitner, who was forced to flee Germany in 1938. During World War II, he worked on the German nuclear weapons program, cataloguing the fission products of uranium. As a consequence, at the end of the war he was arrested by the Allied forces; he was incarcerated in Farm Hall with nine other German scientists, from July 1945 to January 1946.
Hahn served as the last president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science in 1946 and as the founding president of its successor, the Max Planck Society from 1948 to 1960. In 1959 he co-founded in Berlin the Federation of German Scientists, a non-governmental organization, which has been committed to the ideal of responsible science.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1943 for joint work with Edward Doisy in discovering vitamin K and its role in human physiology. Dam's key experiment involved feeding a cholesterol-free diet to chickens. He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC). McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites. Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that—together with the cholesterol—a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin.
He received an undergraduate degree in chemistry from the Copenhagen Polytechnic Institute (now the Technical University of Denmark) in 1920, and was appointed as assistant instructor in chemistry at the School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine. By 1923 he had attained the post of instructor in biochemistry at the University of Copenhagen's Physiological Laboratory. He studied microchemistry at the University of Graz under Fritz Pregl in 1925, but returned to the University of Copenhagen, where he was appointed as an assistant professor at the Institute of Biochemistry in 1928, and assistant professor in 1929. During his time as professor at the University of Copenhagen he spent some time working abroad, and in 1934 submitted a thesis entitled Nogle Undersøgelser over Sterinernes Biologiske Betydning (Some investigations on the biological significance of the sterines) to the University of Copenhagen, and received the degree of PhD in biochemistry.
Between 1942 and 1945 Dam was a senior research associate at the University of Rochester; it was during this period that he was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

Doisy was born in Hume, Illinois, on November 13, 1893. He completed his A.B. degree in 1914 and his M.S. degree in 1916 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He completed his Ph.D. in 1920 from Harvard University.In 1919 he accepted a faculty appointment in the Department of Biochemistry at Washington University in St. Louis, where he rose in rank to associate professor. In 1923, he moved to Saint Louis University as professor and chairman of the new Department of Biochemistry. He served as professor and chairman of that department until he retired in 1965. Saint Louis University renamed the department the E.A. Doisy Department of Biochemistry, in his honor. More recently, the department has again been renamed. It is now known as the E.A. Doisy Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
In 1940, he was a lecturer in medicine at the University of Chicago School of Medicine.He also competed with Adolf Butenandt in the discovery of estrone in 1930. They discovered the substance independently, but only Butenandt was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1939.

He is known for his work on uranium-isotope separation for the Manhattan Project, as well as for founding the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
A graduate of the University of South Dakota and University of Minnesota, Lawrence obtained a PhD in physics at Yale in 1925. In 1928, he was hired as an associate professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, becoming the youngest full professor there two years later. In its library one evening, Lawrence was intrigued by a diagram of an accelerator that produced high-energy particles. He contemplated how it could be made compact, and came up with an idea for a circular accelerating chamber between the poles of an electromagnet. The result was the first cyclotron.
Lawrence went on to build a series of ever larger and more expensive cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California in 1936, with Lawrence as its director. In addition to the use of the cyclotron for physics, Lawrence also supported its use in research into medical uses of radioisotopes. During World War II, Lawrence developed electromagnetic isotope separation at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. A huge electromagnetic separation plant was built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which came to be called Y-12. The process was inefficient, but it worked.
After the war, Lawrence campaigned extensively for government sponsorship of large scientific programs, and was a forceful advocate of ""Big Science"", with its requirements for big machines and big money. Lawrence strongly backed Edward Teller's campaign for a second nuclear weapons laboratory, which Lawrence located in Livermore, California. After his death, the Regents of the University of California renamed the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory after him.

The drug became the first commercially available antibiotic and marketed under the brand name Prontosil.While working in the pathology department of the University of Münster, Domagk was invited to join the IG Farben branch at Elberfeld (later Wuppertal) in 1927. His duty was to test chemical compounds prepared at the IG Farben laboratory for potential drugs.

788,Enrico Fermi,The Nobel Prize in Physics,1938,1901,Italy,1954, 1/1 ,"Rome University, Rome, Italy "," “for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons” ",,,,,"Enrico Fermi (Italian: [enˈriːko ˈfermi]; 29 September 1901 – 28 November 1954) was an Italian and later naturalized American physicist and the creator of the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. He has been called the ""architect of the nuclear age"" and the ""architect of the atomic bomb"". He was one of very few physicists to excel in both theoretical physics and experimental physics. Fermi was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of transuranium elements. With his colleagues, Fermi filed several patents related to the use of nuclear power, all of which were taken over by the US government. He made significant contributions to the development of statistical mechanics, quantum theory, and nuclear and particle physics.
Fermi's first major contribution involved the field of statistical mechanics. After Wolfgang Pauli formulated his exclusion principle in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an ideal gas, employing a statistical formulation now known as Fermi–Dirac statistics. Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called ""fermions"". Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during beta decay, to satisfy the law of conservation of energy. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the ""neutrino"". His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction and now called weak interaction, described one of the four fundamental interactions in nature. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered neutron, Fermi discovered that slow neutrons were more easily captured by atomic nuclei than fast ones, and he developed the Fermi age equation to describe this. After bombarding thorium and uranium with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements. Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were later revealed to be nuclear fission products.
Fermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new Italian racial laws that affected his Jewish wife, Laura Capon. He emigrated to the United States, where he worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. Fermi led the team at the University of Chicago that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went critical on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first human-created, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. He was on hand when the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee went critical in 1943, and when the B Reactor at the Hanford Site did so the next year. At Los Alamos, he headed F Division, part of which worked on Edward Teller's thermonuclear ""Super"" bomb. He was present at the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, where he used his Fermi method to estimate the bomb's yield.
After the war, Fermi served under J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters. After the detonation of the first Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.

She and her parents spent their summers in a villa in Kuling, Mountain Lu, Jiujiang, and it was during this annual pilgrimage that the young girl decided to become a writer. She graduated from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, then returned to China. From 1914 to 1932, after marrying John Lossing Buck, she served as a Presbyterian missionary, but she came to doubt the need for foreign missions. Her views became controversial during the Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy, leading to her resignation. After returning to the United States in 1935, she married the publisher Richard J.

807,James Chadwick,The Nobel Prize in Physics,1935,1891,United Kingdom,1974, 1/1 ,"Liverpool University, Liverpool, United Kingdom ", “for the discovery of the neutron” ,,,,,"Sir James Chadwick,  (20 October 1891 – 24 July 1974) was a British physicist who was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the neutron in 1932. In 1941, he wrote the final draft of the MAUD Report, which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious atom bomb research efforts. He was the head of the British team that worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He was knighted in Britain in 1945 for his achievements in physics.
Chadwick graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester in 1911, where he studied under Ernest Rutherford (known as the ""father of nuclear physics""). At Manchester, he continued to study under Rutherford until he was awarded his MSc in 1913. The same year, Chadwick was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. He elected to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger in Berlin. Using Geiger's recently developed Geiger counter, Chadwick was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a continuous spectrum, and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when World War I broke out in Europe, he spent the next four years in the Ruhleben internment camp.
After the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.
During the Second World War, Chadwick carried out research as part of the Tube Alloys project to build an atom bomb, while his Manchester lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, he became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948.

He played a significant role in the development of the atom bomb, as well as contributing to theories on the development of organic life from non-living matter.Born in Walkerton, Indiana, Urey studied thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis at the University of California, Berkeley. After he received his PhD in 1923, he was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. He was a research associate at Johns Hopkins University before becoming an associate professor of chemistry at Columbia University. In 1931, he began work with the separation of isotopes that resulted in the discovery of deuterium.
During World War II, Urey turned his knowledge of isotope separation to the problem of uranium enrichment. He headed the group located at Columbia University that developed isotope separation using gaseous diffusion. The method was successfully developed, becoming the sole method used in the early post-war period. After the war, Urey became professor of chemistry at the Institute for Nuclear Studies, and later Ryerson professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago.
Urey speculated that the early terrestrial atmosphere was composed of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen. One  of his Chicago graduate students was Stanley L. Miller, who showed in the Miller–Urey experiment that, if such a mixture were exposed to electric sparks and water, it can interact to produce amino acids, commonly considered the building blocks of life. Work with isotopes of oxygen led to pioneering the new field of paleoclimatic research. In 1958, he accepted a post as a professor at large at the new University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where he helped create the science faculty. He was one of the founding members of UCSD's school of chemistry, which was created in 1960. He became increasingly interested in space science, and when Apollo 11 returned Moon rock samples from the Moon, Urey examined them at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.

His father, Thomas Francis Murphy, was a congregational minister of English and Irish heritage. His mother, Rosa Anna Parry, was of a Welsh landowning background. Murphy was educated at the public schools of Wisconsin and Oregon. He completed his A.B. degree in 1914 from the University of Oregon. He completed his M.D. in 1922 from Harvard Medical School.In 1924, Murphy bled dogs to make them anemic (work inspired by war injury work), and then fed them various substances to gauge their improvement. He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to restore anemia more quickly of all foods. Minot and Whipple then set about to chemically isolate the curative substance. These investigations showed that iron in the liver was responsible for curing anemia from bleeding, but meanwhile liver had been tried on people with pernicious anemia and some effect as seen there, also. The active ingredient in this case, found serendipitously, was not iron, but rather a water-soluble extract containing a new substance. From this extract, chemists were ultimately were able to isolate vitamin B12 from the liver. Even before the vitamin had been completely characterized, the knowledge that raw liver and its extracts treated pernicious anemia (previously a terminal disease) was a major advance in medicine. Minot and Murphy's famous paper Treatment of pernicious anemia by a special diet was published in 1926.In 1930, Murphy was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh with George Minot.
Murphy married Pearl Harriett Adams (died 1980) on September 10, 1919. They had a son, William P.

In particular, he is recognized for postulating the Schrödinger equation, an equation that provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time.
In addition, he wrote many works on various aspects of physics: statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, physics of dielectrics, colour theory, electrodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology, and he made several attempts to construct a unified field theory. In his book What Is Life? Schrödinger addressed the problems of genetics, looking at the phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics. He also paid great attention to the philosophical aspects of science, ancient, and oriental philosophical concepts, ethics, and religion. He also wrote on philosophy and theoretical biology. In popular culture, he is best known for his ""Schrödinger's cat"" thought experiment.Spending most of his life as an academic with positions at various universities, Schrödinger, along with Paul Dirac, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his work on quantum mechanics, the same year he left Germany due to his opposition to Nazism. In his personal life, he lived with both his wife and his mistress which may have led to problems causing him to leave his position at Oxford.

Dirac made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. Among other discoveries, he formulated the Dirac equation which describes the behaviour of fermions and predicted the existence of antimatter. Dirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics with Erwin Schrödinger ""for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory"". He also made significant contributions to the reconciliation of general relativity with quantum mechanics.
Dirac was regarded by his friends and colleagues as unusual in character. In a 1926 letter to Paul Ehrenfest, Albert Einstein wrote of a Dirac paper, ""I  am toiling over Dirac.

Langmuir became embroiled in a priority dispute with Lewis over this work; Langmuir's presentation skills were largely responsible for the popularization of the theory, although the credit for the theory itself belongs mostly to Lewis. While at General Electric from 1909 to 1950, Langmuir advanced several fields of physics and chemistry, inventing the gas-filled incandescent lamp and the hydrogen welding technique. The Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research near Socorro, New Mexico, was named in his honor, as was the American Chemical Society journal for surface science called Langmuir.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Langmuir,67,"['1881 births', '1957 deaths', '20th-century American chemists', 'American Nobel laureates', 'American agnostics', 'American meteorologists', 'American physical chemists', 'American plasma physicists', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with Internet Archive links', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Leopoldina identifiers', 'Articles with MGP identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Scopus identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with ZBMATH identifiers', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Chestnut Hill Academy alumni', 'Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science alumni', 'Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'Foreign Members of the Royal Society', 'General Electric people', 'Nobel laureates in Chemistry', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Presidents of the Institute of Radio Engineers', 'Scientists from Schenectady, New York', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'University of Göttingen alumni', 'Use mdy dates from December 2021']",46,22

827,John Galsworthy,The Nobel Prize in Literature,1932,1867,United Kingdom,1933, 1/1 ,, “for his distinguished art of narration which takes its highest form in The Forsyte Saga” ,,,,,"John Galsworthy  (; 14 August 1867 – 31 January 1933) was an English novelist and playwright. He is best known for his trilogy of novels collectively called The Forsyte Saga, and two later trilogies, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. He was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Literature.
Born to a prosperous upper-middle-class family, Galsworthy was destined for a career as a lawyer, but found it uncongenial and turned instead to writing. He was thirty before his first book was published in 1897, and did not achieve real success until 1906, when The Man of Property, the first of his novels about the Forsyte family was published. In the same year his first play, The Silver Box was staged in London. As a dramatist he became known for plays with a social message, reflecting, among other themes, the struggle of workers against exploitation, the use of solitary confinement in prisons, the repression of women, and jingoism and the politics and morality of war.
The Forsyte family of the series of novels and short stories collectively known as The Forsyte Chronicles is similar in many ways to Galsworthy's family, and the patriarch, Old Jolyon, is modelled on Galsworthy's father. The main sequence runs from the late 19th century to the early 1930s, featuring three generations of the family. The books were popular when first published and their latter-day popularity was boosted considerably when BBC Television broadcast a 26-part adaptation for the author's centenary in 1967.
As well as writing plays and novels with social messages, Galsworthy campaigned continually for a wide range of causes about which he felt strongly, from animal welfare to prison reform, censorship and workers' rights. Although seen by many as a radical, he belonged to and supported no political party. His plays are seldom revived, but his novels have been frequently reissued.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galsworthy,86,"['1867 births', '1933 deaths', '19th-century male writers', '20th-century English novelists', 'Alumni of New College, Oxford', 'Animal welfare scholars', 'Anti-vivisectionists', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with BNMM identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with Internet Archive links', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with LibriVox links', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with Open Library links', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with Project Gutenberg links', 'Articles with RISM identifiers', 'Articles with RSL identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'British Nobel laureates', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'English Nobel laureates', 'English animal rights activists', 'English dramatists and playwrights', 'English essayists', 'English humanitarians', 'English male dramatists and playwrights', 'English male novelists', 'Members of the Order of Merit', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Pages containing links to subscription-only content', 'People educated at Harrow School', 'People from Kingston upon Thames', 'Presidents of the English Centre of PEN', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Use British English from April 2023', 'Use dmy dates from April 2023']",65,225

She was an important leader in the history of social work and women's suffrage in the United States. Addams co-founded Chicago's Hull House, one of America's most famous settlement houses, providing extensive social services to poor, largely immigrant families. In 1910, Addams was awarded an honorary master of arts degree from Yale University, becoming the first woman to receive an honorary degree from the school. In 1920, she was a co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).An advocate for world peace, and recognized as the founder of the social work profession in the United States, in 1931 Addams became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. She was a radical pragmatist and arguably the first woman ""public philosopher"" in the United States. In the Progressive Era, when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers. She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace. In her essay ""Utilization of Women in City Government"", Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household, stating that many departments of government, such as sanitation and the schooling of children, could be traced back to traditional women's roles in the private sphere.

Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and frequency. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called ""modified scattering"" was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.Born to Tamil Brahmin parents, Raman was a precocious child, completing his secondary and higher secondary education from St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School at the age of 11 and 13, respectively. He topped the bachelor's degree examination of the University of Madras with honours in physics from Presidency College at age 16. His first research paper, on diffraction of light, was published in 1906 while he was still a graduate student. The next year he obtained a master's degree. He joined the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta as Assistant Accountant General at age 19. There he became acquainted with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute in India, which allowed him to carry out independent research and where he made his major contributions in acoustics and optics.
In 1917, he was appointed the first Palit Professor of Physics by Ashutosh Mukherjee at the Rajabazar Science College under the University of Calcutta. On his first trip to Europe, seeing the Mediterranean Sea motivated him to identify the prevailing explanation for the blue colour of the sea at the time, namely the reflected Rayleigh-scattered light from the sky, as being incorrect. He founded the Indian Journal of Physics in 1926. He moved to Bangalore in 1933 to become the first Indian director of the Indian Institute of Science. He founded the Indian Academy of Sciences the same year. He established the Raman Research Institute in 1948 where he worked to his last days.
The Raman effect was discovered on 28 February 1928. The day is celebrated annually by the Government of India as the National Science Day.

In his 1924 PhD thesis, he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties. This concept is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, an example of wave–particle duality, and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics.
De Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929, after the wave-like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927.
The 1925 pilot-wave model, and the wave-like behaviour of particles discovered by de Broglie was used by Erwin Schrödinger in his formulation of wave mechanics. The pilot-wave model and interpretation was then abandoned, in favor of the quantum formalism, until 1952 when it was rediscovered and enhanced by David Bohm.Louis de Broglie was the sixteenth member elected to occupy seat 1 of the Académie française in 1944, and served as Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences.

It was a sensational discovery at the time: the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated, but the idea that light had both wave and particle properties was not easily accepted. He is also known for his leadership over the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago during the Manhattan Project, and served as chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis from 1945 to 1953.
In 1919, Compton was awarded one of the first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad. He chose to go to the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles.
During World War II, Compton was a key figure in the Manhattan Project that developed the first nuclear weapons. His reports were important in launching the project. In 1942, he became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory, with responsibility for producing nuclear reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, finding ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to design an atomic bomb. Compton oversaw Enrico Fermi's creation of Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor, which went critical on December 2, 1942. The Metallurgical Laboratory was also responsible for the design and operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Plutonium began being produced in the Hanford Site reactors in 1945.
After the war, Compton became chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis.

856,Ludwig Quidde,The Nobel Peace Prize,1927,1858,Germany,1941, 1/2 ,, “for their contribution to the emergence in France and Germany of a public opinion which favours peaceful international cooperation” ,,,,,"Ludwig Quidde (German pronunciation: [ˈluːtvɪç ˈkvɪdə] (listen); 23 March 1858, Free City of Bremen – 4 March 1941, Geneva, Switzerland) was a German politician and pacifist who is mainly remembered today for his acerbic criticism of German Emperor Wilhelm II. Quidde's long career spanned four different eras of German history: Otto von Bismarck (until 1890), the Hohenzollern Empire under Wilhelm II (1888–1918), the Weimar Republic (1918–1933); and [Nazi Germany]]. In 1927, Quidde was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.Born into a wealthy bourgeois merchant family, Quidde grew up in Bremen, read history and got involved in the activities of the German Peace Society (Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft). In his younger years, he had already opposed Bismarck's policies. In 1881 he received his PhD at the University of Göttingen.

The fortune that Quidde inherited allowed him to devote himself entirely to politics. In 1893, he joined the German People's Party (DtVP), which was founded in 1868 and met his anti-militarist, anti-Prussian, democratic and pacifist expectations.In 1894, Quidde published a 17-page pamphlet, Caligula. Eine Studie über römischen Caesarenwahnsinn (Caligula: A Study of Imperial Insanity). Containing 79 footnotes, the short essay is exclusively about the Roman Empire of the 1st century AD. However, Quidde drew an implicit parallel between the Roman Emperor Caligula and Wilhelm II and de facto accused both rulers of megalomania. The author had insisted on publishing his pamphlet under his real name, which effectively ended his academic career as a historian when a periodical had a short review, which explained the parallels thst otherwise might have gone unnoticed. After he had made a derogatory comment on a new medal in honour of Wilhelm I, German Emperor from 1871 to 1888, he was criminally convicted of lèse majesté and sentenced to three months in prison, which he served in Stadelheim Prison.
After the end of the First World War, Quidde, like most other Germans, vehemently opposed the Treaty of Versailles but for different reasons from German militarists, who hated mainly the vast restrictions laid upon the German armed forces and the impending economic disaster that they stages would be caused by payment of the high reparations that the tretaty decreed. He and other German pacifists thought ahead and hoped that US President Woodrow Wilson would win the day by pointing out that such severe conditions would already sow the seeds of a new war:

A humiliated and torn German nation condemned to economic misery would be a constant danger to world peace, just as a protected German nation whose inalienable rights and subsistence are safeguarded would be a strong pillar of such world peace.
May those who are in power today think beyond this day and consider the future of mankind. Their responsibility is enormous. Today, an altogether new order can be created for the benefit of all peoples. Short-sighted misuse of that power can ruin everything.

When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Quidde escaped to Switzerland and finally settled down in Geneva for the rest of his days. He remained an optimist throughout his life. Aged 76, he published his essay ""Landfriede und Weltfriede"" (1934) while militarism was again on the rise. He believed that modern technology might serve as a deterrent from war:

[It is] today's technological development which has turned modern war into a suicidal nightmare and which will put an end to war. This was already predicted by Kant, who expected ""perpetual peace"" to be established not due to the moral perfection of man but due to modern warfare, which would be so unbearable that mankind would see itself forced to guarantee everlasting peace.

He was the recipient of the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for his discovery of the Spiroptera carcinoma"". He demonstrated that the roundworm which he called Spiroptera carcinoma (but correctly named Gongylonema neoplasticum) could cause stomach cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) in rats and mice. His experimental results were later proven to be a case of mistaken conclusion. Erling Norrby, who had served as the Permanent Secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and Professor and Chairman of Virology at the Karolinska Institute, declared Fibiger's Nobel Prize as ""one of the biggest blunders made by the Karolinska Institute.""While working at the Institute of Pathological Anatomy of University of Copenhagen, Fibiger discovered new roundworms in 1907 from wild rats. He suspected that the roundworms were responsible for stomach cancer in those rats. In 1913, he reported that he could experimentally induce cancer in healthy rats using the roundworms. His discovery was considered ""the greatest contribution to experimental medicine"" at the time. In 1926, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Katsusaburo Yamagiwa, who had experimentally induced carcinoma by painting crude coal tar on the inner surface of rabbits' ears in 1915. However, they were considered undeserving, and the 1926 prize was not given. In the next year Fibiger alone was retrospectively chosen for the 1926 Nobel Prize.
After his death, independent researches proved that G. neoplasticum cannot cause cancer. Tumours and cancer produced by Fibiger were due to vitamin A deficiency. Historical reassessment of Fibiger's data revealed that he had mistaken non-cancerous tumours for cancerous tumours.

862,Gustav Stresemann,The Nobel Peace Prize,1926,1878,Germany,1929, 1/2 ,, “for their crucial role in bringing about the Locarno Treaty” ,,,,,"Gustav Ernst Stresemann (German pronunciation: [ˈɡʊstaf ˈʃtʁeːzəˌman] (listen); 10 May 1878 – 3 October 1929) was a German statesman who served as chancellor of Germany from August to November 1923, and as foreign minister from 1923 to 1929. His most notable achievement was the reconciliation between Germany and France, for which he and French Prime Minister Aristide Briand received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926. During a period of political instability and fragile, short-lived governments, Stresemann was the most influential politician in most of the Weimar Republic's existence.
Stresemann attended the University of Berlin and Leipzig University, where he studied political economy, history and international law and developed his vision of liberalism and nationalism, a combination of views that would define his political career. After obtaining his doctorate, Stresemann worked in trade associations before entering politics. In 1907, he was elected to the Reichstag as a deputy for the National Liberal Party. He lost his seat in 1912 but was reelected two years later. During the First World War, he was a vocal advocate for German militarism and expansionism. Exempted from war service due to poor health, he gradually became the National Liberals' de facto leader, before formally taking over the party in 1917. Germany's defeat and the fall of the Hohenzollern monarchy came as a significant shock to Stresemann, forcing him to gradually reassess his previous positions. He founded the German People's Party (DVP) and, despite his own monarchist beliefs, came to grudgingly accept Weimar democracy and became open to working with the centre and the left.
In August 1923, Stresemann was named chancellor and foreign minister of a grand coalition government. During his brief chancellorship, he abandoned the policy of passive resistance against the French-Belgian occupation of the Ruhr, and introduced the Rentenmark in an attempt to tackle hyperinflation in the country. In November, Stresemann's reshuffled government collapsed after the Social Democratics withdrew from the coalition. He resigned as chancellor following a vote of no confidence, but remained as foreign minister in the new government led by Wilhelm Marx. His first major diplomatic success was the 1924 Dawes Plan, which reduced Germany's overall reparations commitment. It was followed by the Locarno Treaties in 1925, which confirmed Germany's postwar western borders, guaranteed peace with France, and provided for Germany's admission to the League of Nations a year later. Stresemann also moved to improve relations with the Soviet Union through the 1926 Treaty of Berlin. In 1928, he oversaw Germany's participation in the Kellogg–Briand Pact, in which signatory states promised not to use war to resolve international conflicts.
Amid failing health, Stresemann successfully negotiated the Young Plan which sought to further reduce German reparations payments. He died in October 1929 after a series of strokes at the age of 51.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Stresemann,70,"['1878 births', '1929 deaths', '20th-century Chancellors of Germany', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing German-language text', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with Internet Archive links', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with Project Gutenberg links', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from November 2020', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'Chancellors of Germany', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'European conservative liberals', 'Foreign Ministers of Germany', 'German Democratic Party politicians', 'German Nobel laureates', ""German People's Party politicians"", 'German Protestants', 'German anti-communists', 'German diplomats', 'Humboldt University of Berlin alumni', 'Leaders of political parties in Germany', 'Members of the 12th Reichstag of the German Empire', 'Members of the 13th Reichstag of the German Empire', 'Members of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic', 'Members of the Weimar National Assembly', 'National Liberal Party (Germany) politicians', 'National-Social Association politicians', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People from the Province of Brandenburg', 'Politicians from Berlin', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Webarchive template wayback links']",57,15

He completed his doctorate in 1906 and his habilitation in 1911 at the Frederick William University in Berlin, where he lectured and taught until 1918, having reached the position of professor extraordinarius. He served as a volunteer in the German Army during World War I. He was seriously injured in 1917 in a gas attack and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class.
Franck became the Head of the Physics Division of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became professor ordinarius of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Göttingen. While there he worked on quantum physics with Max Born, who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. His work included the Franck–Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the Bohr model of the atom. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer and Hilde Levi.
After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, Franck resigned his post in protest against the dismissal of fellow academics. He assisted Frederick Lindemann in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933. After a year at the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark, he moved to the United States, where he worked at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and then the University of Chicago. During this period he became interested in photosynthesis.
Franck participated in the Manhattan Project during World War II as Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory.

866,George Bernard Shaw,The Nobel Prize in Literature,1925,1856,Ireland,1950, 1/1 ,," “for his work which is marked by both idealism and humanity, its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty” ",,,,,"George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950), known at his insistence as Bernard Shaw, was an Irish playwright, critic, polemicist and political activist. His influence on Western theatre, culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as Man and Superman (1902), Pygmalion (1913) and Saint Joan (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success, Arms and the Man in 1894. Influenced by Henrik Ibsen, he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political, social and religious ideas. By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara, The Doctor's Dilemma, and Caesar and Cleopatra.
Shaw's expressed views were often contentious; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform, and opposed vaccination and organised religion. He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable, and although not a republican, castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success. In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a filmed version of Pygmalion for which he received an Academy Award. His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished; by the late 1920s, he had largely renounced Fabian Society gradualism, and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and left—he expressed admiration for both Mussolini and Stalin. In the final decade of his life, he made fewer public statements but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death, aged ninety-four, having refused all state honours, including the Order of Merit in 1946.
Since Shaw's death scholarly and critical opinion about his works has varied, but he has regularly been rated among British dramatists as second only to Shakespeare; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of English-language playwrights.

867,Sir Austen Chamberlain,The Nobel Peace Prize,1925,1863,United Kingdom,1937, 1/2 ,, “for his crucial role in bringing about the Locarno Treaty” ,,,,,"Sir Joseph Austen Chamberlain  (16 October 1863 – 16 March 1937) was a British statesman, son of Joseph Chamberlain and older half-brother of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer (twice) and was briefly Conservative Party leader before serving as Foreign Secretary.
Brought up to be the political heir of his father, whom he physically resembled, he was elected to Parliament as a Liberal Unionist at a by-election in 1892, and held office in the Unionist coalition governments of 1895–1905, remaining in the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1903–05) after his father resigned in 1903 to campaign for Tariff Reform. After his father's disabling stroke in 1906 Austen became the leading tariff reformer in the House of Commons. Late in 1911 he and Walter Long were due to fight one another for the leadership of the Conservative Party (in succession to Arthur Balfour), but both withdrew in favour of Bonar Law rather than risk a party split on a close result.
Chamberlain returned to office in H. H. Asquith's wartime coalition government in May 1915, as Secretary of State for India, but resigned to take responsibility for the disastrous Kut Campaign. He again returned to office in David Lloyd George's coalition government, once again serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He then served as Conservative Party leader in the Commons (1921–2), before resigning after the Carlton Club meeting voted to end the Lloyd George Coalition.
Like many leading coalitionists, he did not hold office in the Conservative governments of 1922–4. By now regarded as an elder statesman, he served an important term as Foreign Secretary in Stanley Baldwin's Second Government (1924–9), during which he negotiated the Locarno Pact (1925), aimed at preventing war between France and Germany, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He last held office as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1931. He was one of the few MPs supporting Winston Churchill's appeals for rearmament against the German threat in the 1930s, and remained an active backbench MP until his death in 1937.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austen_Chamberlain,60,"['1863 births', '1937 deaths', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from September 2015', 'British Nobel laureates', 'British Secretaries of State', 'British Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs', 'Burials at East Finchley Cemetery', 'CS1 errors', 'CS1', 'Chamberlain family', 'Chancellors of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom', 'Chancellors of the University of Reading', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies', 'English Nobel laureates', 'English Unitarians', 'First Lords of the Admiralty', 'Humboldt University of Berlin alumni', 'Knights of the Garter', 'Leaders of the Conservative Party (UK)', 'Leaders of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom', 'Liberal Unionist Party MPs for English constituencies', 'Lords Privy Seal', 'Lords of the Admiralty', 'Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People educated at Rugby School', 'People from Mayfield, East Sussex', 'Rectors of the University of Glasgow', 'Sciences Po alumni', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'UK MPs 1892–1895', 'UK MPs 1895–1900', 'UK MPs 1900–1906', 'UK MPs 1906–1910', 'UK MPs 1910', 'UK MPs 1910–1918', 'UK MPs 1918–1922', 'UK MPs 1922–1923', 'UK MPs 1923–1924', 'UK MPs 1924–1929', 'UK MPs 1929–1931', 'UK MPs 1931–1935', 'UK MPs 1935–1945', 'United Kingdom Postmasters General', 'Use dmy dates from February 2020', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1922 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB']",75,14

He was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925 for his work on the Dawes Plan for World War I reparations.
Born in Marietta, Ohio, Dawes attended Cincinnati Law School before beginning a legal career in Lincoln, Nebraska.  After serving as a gas plant executive, he managed William McKinley's 1896 presidential campaign in Illinois. After the election, McKinley appointed Dawes as the Comptroller of the Currency. He remained in that position until 1901 before forming the Central Trust Company of Illinois. Dawes served as a general during World War I and was the chairman of the general purchasing board for the American Expeditionary Forces. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Dawes as the first director of the Bureau of the Budget. Dawes served on the Allied Reparations Commission, where he helped formulate the Dawes Plan to aid the struggling German economy. 
The 1924 Republican National Convention nominated President Calvin Coolidge without opposition. After former Governor of Illinois Frank Lowden declined the vice-presidential nomination, the convention chose Dawes as Coolidge's running mate. The Republican ticket won the 1924 presidential election, and Dawes was sworn in as vice president in 1925. Dawes helped pass the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill in Congress, but President Coolidge vetoed it. Dawes was a candidate for renomination at the 1928 Republican National Convention, but Coolidge's opposition to Dawes helped ensure that Charles Curtis was nominated instead. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover appointed Dawes to be the Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Dawes also briefly led the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which organized a government response to the Great Depression. He resigned from that position in 1932 to return to banking, and died in 1951 of coronary thrombosis.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_G._Dawes,67,"['1865 births', '1924 United States vice-presidential candidates', '1951 deaths', '19th-century American politicians', '20th-century American diplomats', '20th-century vice presidents of the United States', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom', 'American Congregationalists', 'American Nobel laureates', 'American bankers', 'American military engineers', 'Articles containing French-language text', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PIC identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with USCongress identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2017', 'Articles with unsourced statements from October 2009', 'Burials at Rosehill Cemetery', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'Coolidge administration cabinet members', 'Coolidge administration personnel', 'Dawes family', 'Directors of the Office of Management and Budget', 'Harding administration cabinet members', 'Hoover administration cabinet members', 'Marietta College alumni', 'McKinley administration personnel', 'Members of the Sons of the American Revolution', 'Members of the United States Assay Commission', 'Military personnel from Ohio', 'Nebraska lawyers', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Ohio Republicans', 'Politicians from Chicago', 'Politicians from Marietta, Ohio', 'Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army)', 'Reconstruction Finance Corporation', 'Republican Party (United States) vice presidential nominees', 'Republican Party vice presidents of the United States', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'Songwriters from Illinois', 'Songwriters from Ohio', 'Theodore Roosevelt administration personnel', 'United States Army generals of World War I', 'United States Comptrollers of the Currency', 'University of Cincinnati College of Law alumni', 'Use mdy dates from July 2022', 'Vice presidents of the United States', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from May 2023', 'Writers from Chicago', 'Writers from Ohio']",79,5

His best-known work is the award-winning four-volume novel Chłopi (The Peasants).
Born into an impoverished noble family, Reymont was educated to become a master tailor, but instead worked as a gateman at a railway station and then as an actor in a troupe. His intensive travels and voyages encouraged him to publish short stories, with notions of literary realism. Reymont's first successful and widely praised novel was The Promised Land from 1899, which brought attention to the bewildering social inequalities, poverty, conflictive multiculturalism and labour exploitation in the industrial city of Łódź (Lodz). The aim of the novel was to extensively emphasize the consequences of extreme industrialization and how it affects society as a whole. In 1900, Reymont was severely injured in a railway accident, which halted his writing career until 1904 when he published the first part of Chłopi.
Władysław Reymont was popular in communist Poland due to his style of writing and the symbolism he used, including socialist concepts, romantic portrayal of the agrarian countryside and toned criticism of capitalism, all present in literary realism. His work is widely attributed to the Young Poland movement, which featured decadence and literary impressionism.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Reymont,84,"['1867 births', '1925 deaths', '19th-century Polish novelists', '19th-century male writers', '20th-century Polish novelists', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with Internet Archive links', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with LibriVox links', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with Project Gutenberg links', 'Articles with RISM identifiers', 'Articles with RSL identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2015', 'Burials at Powązki Cemetery', 'Commons link from Wikidata', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'People from Radomsko', 'Polish Nobel laureates', 'Polish cooperative organizers', 'Polish male novelists', 'Recipients of the Order of Polonia Restituta', 'Short description is different from Wikidata']",52,2

Millikan graduated from Oberlin College in 1891 and obtained his doctorate at Columbia University in 1895. In 1896 he became an assistant at the University of Chicago, where he became a full professor in 1910. In 1909 Millikan began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron. He began by measuring the course of charged water droplets in an electric field. The results suggested that the charge on the droplets is a multiple of the elementary electric charge, but the experiment was not accurate enough to be convincing. He obtained more precise results in 1910 with his oil-drop experiment in which he replaced water (which tended to evaporate too quickly) with oil.
In 1914 Millikan took up with similar skill the experimental verification of the equation introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 to describe the photoelectric effect. He used this same research to obtain an accurate value of Planck’s constant. In 1921 Millikan left the University of Chicago to become director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. There he undertook a major study of the radiation that the physicist Victor Hess had detected coming from outer space. Millikan proved that this radiation is indeed of extraterrestrial origin, and he named it ""cosmic rays."" As chairman of the Executive Council of Caltech (the school's governing body at the time) from 1921 until his retirement in 1945, Millikan helped to turn the school into one of the leading research institutions in the United States.

876,William Butler Yeats,The Nobel Prize in Literature,1923,1865,Ireland,1939, 1/1 ,," “for his always inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation” ",,,,,"William Butler Yeats (13 June 1865 – 28 January 1939) was an Irish poet, dramatist, writer, and politician. One of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature in the English-speaking canon, he was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival and became a pillar of the Irish literary establishment who helped to found the Abbey Theatre. In his later years, he served two terms as a Senator of the Irish Free State.
A Protestant of Anglo-Irish descent, Yeats was born in Sandymount, Ireland. He was educated in Dublin and London and spent childhood holidays in County Sligo. He studied poetry from an early age, when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. He was influenced by John Keats, William Wordsworth, William Blake and many more. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, lasting roughly from his student days at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.
From 1900 his poetry grew more physical, realistic and politicised. He moved away from the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with some elements including cyclical theories of life. He had become the chief playwright for the Irish Literary Theatre in 1897, and early on promoted younger poets such as Ezra Pound. Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923.

877,Niels Henrik David Bohr,The Nobel Prize in Physics,1922,1885,Denmark,1962, 1/1 ,"Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark ", “for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them” ,,,,,"Niels Henrik David Bohr (Danish: [ˈne̝ls ˈpoɐ̯ˀ]; 7 October 1885 – 18 November 1962) was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.
Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.
Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, now known as the Niels Bohr Institute, which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including Hans Kramers, Oskar Klein, George de Hevesy, and Werner Heisenberg. He predicted the existence of a new zirconium-like element, which was named hafnium, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element bohrium was named after him.
During the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from Nazism. After Denmark was occupied by the Germans, he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the German nuclear weapon project. In September 1943 word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, so he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr,136,"['1885 births', '1962 deaths', '20th-century Danish philosophers', '20th-century Danish physicists', 'Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester', 'Akademisk Boldklub players', 'Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge', 'Articles containing Croatian-language text', 'Articles containing Danish-language text', 'Articles containing Latin-language text', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with Google Scholar identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with Leopoldina identifiers', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MATHSN identifiers', 'Articles with MGP identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with Project Gutenberg links', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Scopus identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with ZBMATH identifiers', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with short description', 'Atoms for Peace Award recipients', 'Biography with signature', 'Bohr family', 'Burials at Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)', 'CS1 Croatian-language sources (hr)', 'CS1 Danish-language sources (da)', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1', 'Corresponding Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1917–1925)', 'Corresponding Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences', 'Danish Jews', 'Danish Nobel laureates', 'Danish atheists', 'Danish expatriates in England', 'Danish expatriates in the United States', ""Danish men's footballers"", 'Danish nuclear physicists', 'Danish people of Jewish descent', 'Danish people of World War II', 'Featured articles', 'Foreign Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy', 'Foreign Members of the Royal Society', 'Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences', 'Grand Crosses of the Order of the Dannebrog', 'Honorary Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences', 'Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars', 'Jewish Nobel laureates', 'Jewish atheists', ""Jewish men's footballers"", 'Jewish philosophers', 'Jewish physicists', 'Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society', 'Manhattan Project people', 'Members of the American Philosophical Society', 'Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin', 'Members of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina', 'Members of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities', 'Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences', 'Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences', 'Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences', ""Men's association football goalkeepers"", 'Niels Bohr', 'Niels Bohr International Gold Medal recipients', 'Nobel laureates in Physics', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata', 'Pages using Sister project links with wikidata mismatch', 'People associated with CERN', 'People associated with the nuclear weapons programme of the United Kingdom', 'People from Gribskov Municipality', 'Philosophers of science', 'Quantum physicists', 'Recipients of the Copley Medal', 'Recipients of the Matteucci Medal', 'Recipients of the Pour le Mérite (civil class)', 'Scientists from Copenhagen', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'Theoretical physicists', 'University of Copenhagen alumni', 'Use British English from October 2013', 'Use dmy dates from March 2022', 'Wikipedia pages semi-protected against vandalism', 'Winners of the Max Planck Medal']",114,2

He gained prominence at various points in his life as an explorer, scientist, diplomat and humanitarian. 
He led the team that made the first crossing of the Greenland interior in 1888, traversing the island on cross-country skis. He won international fame after reaching a record northern latitude of 86°14′ during his Fram expedition of 1893–1896. Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent Arctic and Antarctic expeditions.
Nansen studied zoology at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania and later worked as a curator at the University Museum of Bergen where his research on the central nervous system of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish neuron doctrine. Later, neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal won the 1906 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his research on the same subject. After 1896 his main scientific interest switched to oceanography; in the course of his research he made many scientific cruises, mainly in the North Atlantic, and contributed to the development of modern oceanographic equipment.
As one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the ending of Norway's union with Sweden, and was instrumental in persuading Prince Carl of Denmark to accept the throne of the newly independent Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.
In the final decade of his life, Nansen devoted himself primarily to the League of Nations, following his appointment in 1921 as the League's High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1922 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of the displaced victims of World War I and related conflicts. Among the initiatives he introduced was the ""Nansen passport"" for stateless persons, a certificate that used to be recognized by more than 50 countries. He worked on behalf of refugees alongside Vidkun Quisling until his sudden death in 1930, after which the League established the Nansen International Office for Refugees to ensure that his work continued. This office received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1938.

883,Albert Einstein,The Nobel Prize in Physics,1921,1879,Germany,1955, 1/1 ,"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut (now Max-Planck-Institut) für Physik, Berlin, Germany "," “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect” ",,,,,"Albert Einstein ( EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called ""the world's most famous equation"". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics ""for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.  His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius.In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity—a theory which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field—and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. The middle part of his career also saw him making important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons.
For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately unsuccessful. Firstly, he fought a long rearguard action against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that ""God does not play dice"". Secondly, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism too. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.
Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life. In 1903, he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, he became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1933, while he was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Alienated by the policies of the newly elected Nazi government, Einstein decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein,216,"['1879 births', '1955 deaths', '19th-century

Hamsun's work spans more than 70 years and shows variation with regard to consciousness, subject, perspective and environment. He published more than 20 novels, a collection of poetry, some short stories and plays, a travelogue, works of non-fiction and some essays.
Hamsun is considered to be ""one of the most influential and innovative literary stylists of the past hundred years"" (ca. 1890–1990). He pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue, and influenced authors such as Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka, Maxim Gorky, Stefan Zweig, Henry Miller, Hermann Hesse, John Fante, James Kelman, Charles Bukowski and Ernest Hemingway. Isaac Bashevis Singer called Hamsun ""the father of the modern school of literature in his every aspect—his subjectiveness, his fragmentariness, his use of flashbacks, his lyricism. The whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun"". Since 1916, several of Hamsun's works have been adapted into motion pictures. On 4 August 2009, the Knut Hamsun Centre was opened in Hamarøy.The young Hamsun objected to realism and naturalism. He argued that the main object of modernist literature should be the intricacies of the human mind, that writers should describe the ""whisper of blood, and the pleading of bone marrow"". Hamsun is considered the ""leader of the Neo-Romantic revolt at the turn of the 20th century"", with works such as Hunger (1890), Mysteries (1892), Pan (1894), and Victoria (1898). His later works—in particular his ""Nordland novels""—were influenced by the Norwegian new realism, portraying everyday life in rural Norway and often employing local dialect, irony, and humour. Hamsun only published one poetry collection, The Wild Choir, which has been set to music by several composers.
Hamsun had strong anti-English views, and openly supported Adolf Hitler and Nazi ideology. Due to his professed support for the German occupation of Norway, he was charged with treason after the war. He was not convicted, due to what was deemed psychological problems and issues with old age.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knut_Hamsun,101,"['1859 births', '1952 deaths', '19th-century Norwegian novelists', '20th-century Norwegian novelists', 'All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles needing additional references from August 2017', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CANTICN identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ICCU identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with Internet Archive links', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with KULTURNAV identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with LibriVox links', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with Project Gutenberg links', 'Articles with RISM identifiers', 'Articles with RSL identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from October 2009', 'CS1 Norwegian Bokmål-language sources (nb)', 'CS1 Norwegian-language sources (no)', 'Commons link is on Wikidata', 'Hamsun family', 'Knut Hamsun', 'Modernist writers', 'Nobel laureates in Literature', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Norwegian Nobel laureates', 'Norwegian anti-communists', 'Norwegian collaborators with Nazi Germany', 'Norwegian male writers', 'Norwegian prisoners and detainees', 'People from Hamarøy', 'People from Lom, Norway', 'Prisoners and detainees of Norway', 'Psychological fiction writers', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'Trials in Norway', 'Use dmy dates from November 2022', 'Webarchive template wayback links']",68,1

896,Thomas Woodrow Wilson,The Nobel Peace Prize,1919,1856,USA,1924, 1/1 ,, “for his role as founder of the League of Nations” ,,,,,"Thomas Woodrow Wilson (December 28, 1856 – February 3, 1924) was an American politician and academic who served as the 28th president of the United States from 1913 to 1921. A member of the Democratic Party, Wilson served as the president of Princeton University and as the governor of New Jersey before winning the 1912 presidential election. As president, Wilson changed the nation's economic policies and led the United States into World War I in 1917. He was the leading architect of the League of Nations, and his progressive stance on foreign policy came to be known as Wilsonianism.
Born in Staunton, Virginia, Wilson grew up in the American South, mainly in Augusta, Georgia, during the Civil War and Reconstruction. After earning a Ph.D. in history and political science from Johns Hopkins University, Wilson taught at various colleges before becoming the president of Princeton University and a spokesman for progressivism in higher education. As governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913, Wilson broke with party bosses and won the passage of several progressive reforms. To win the presidential nomination he mobilized progressives and Southerners to his cause at the 1912 Democratic National Convention. Wilson defeated incumbent Republican William Howard Taft and third-party nominee Theodore Roosevelt to easily win the 1912 United States presidential election, becoming the first Southerner to do so since 1848. During his first year as president, Wilson authorized the widespread imposition of segregation inside the federal bureaucracy. He ousted many African Americans from federal posts and his opposition to women's suffrage drew protests. His first term was largely devoted to pursuing passage of his progressive New Freedom domestic agenda. His first major priority was the Revenue Act of 1913, which lowered tariffs and began the modern income tax. Wilson also negotiated the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, which created the Federal Reserve System. Two major laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act, were enacted to promote business competition and combat extreme corporate power.
At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the U.S. declared neutrality as Wilson tried to negotiate a peace between the Allied and Central Powers. He narrowly won re-election in the 1916 United States presidential election, boasting how he kept the nation out of wars in Europe and Mexico. In April 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany in response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare that sank American merchant ships. Wilson nominally presided over war-time mobilization and left military matters to the generals. He instead concentrated on diplomacy, issuing the Fourteen Points that the Allies and Germany accepted as a basis for post-war peace. He wanted the off-year elections of 1918 to be a referendum endorsing his policies, but instead the Republicans took control of Congress. After the Allied victory in November 1918, Wilson went to Paris where he and the British and French leaders dominated the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson successfully advocated for the establishment of a multinational organization, the League of Nations. It was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles that he signed. Wilson had refused to bring any leading Republican into the Paris talks, and back home he rejected a Republican compromise that would have allowed the Senate to ratify the Versailles Treaty and join the League.
Wilson had intended to seek a third term in office but suffered a severe stroke in October 1919 that left him incapacitated. His wife and his doctor controlled Wilson, and no significant decisions were made. Meanwhile, his policies alienated German- and Irish-American Democrats and the Republicans won a landslide in the 1920 presidential election. Scholars have generally ranked Wilson in the upper tier of U.S. presidents, although he has been criticized for supporting racial segregation. His liberalism nevertheless lives on as a major factor in American foreign policy, and his vision of ethnic self-determination resonated globally.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson,141,"['1856 births', '1924 deaths', '19th-century American people', '19th-century Presbyterians', '20th-century Presbyterians', '20th-century presidents of the United States', 'All Wikipedia articles written in American English', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'American Nobel laureates', 'American Presbyterians', 'American lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law', 'American people of World War I', 'American segregationists', 'Articles containing video clips', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNE identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with EMU identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with Internet Archive links', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with LNB identifiers', 'Articles with LibriVox links', 'Articles with Libris identifiers', 'Articles with MGP identifiers', 'Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Articles with NARA identifiers', 'Articles with NDL identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLA identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NLK identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with Project Gutenberg links', 'Articles with RISM identifiers', 'Articles with RSL identifiers', 'Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Trove identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with VcBA identifiers', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2023', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2022', 'Bourbon Democrats', 'Bryn Mawr College faculty', 'Burials at Washington National Cathedral', 'CS1 maint', 'CS1', 'CS1', 'Candidates in the 1912 United States presidential election', 'Candidates in the 1916 United States presidential election', 'Democratic Party (United States) presidential nominees', 'Democratic Party governors of New Jersey', 'Democratic Party presidents of the United States', 'Dunning School', 'Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'Georgia (U.S. state) lawyers', 'Good articles', 'Governors of New Jersey', 'Hall of Fame for Great Americans inductees', 'Johns Hopkins University alumni', 'League of Nations people', 'Liberalism in the United States', 'Members of the American Philosophical Society', 'Neo-Confederates', 'Neurological disease deaths in Washington, D.C.', 'New Jersey Democrats', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata', 'People from Kalorama (Washington, D.C.)', 'People from Princeton, New Jersey', 'People from Staunton, Virginia', 'People of the Russian Civil War', 'Politicians from Augusta, Georgia', 'Politicians from Staunton, Virginia', 'Presbyterians from New Jersey', 'Presidency of Woodrow Wilson', 'Presidents of Princeton University', 'Presidents of the American Historical Association', 'Presidents of the United States', 'Princeton University alumni', 'Princeton University faculty', 'Progressive Era in the United States', 'Progressivism in the United States', 'Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Poland)', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'University of Virginia faculty', 'Use American English from January 2021', 'Use mdy dates from July 2022', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wesleyan Cardinals football coaches', 'Wesleyan University faculty', 'Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from August 2022', 'Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from February 2019', 'Wikipedia pages semi-protected against vandalism', 'Woodrow Wilson', 'Woodrow Wilson family']",113,10

This invention is important for the large-scale synthesis of fertilisers and explosives. It is estimated that one-third of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber–Bosch process, and that this supports nearly half of the world's population.  Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born–Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid.
Haber, a known German nationalist, is also considered the ""father of chemical warfare"" for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponising chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I. He first proposed the use of the heavier-than-air chlorine gas as a weapon to break the trench deadlock during the Second Battle of Ypres. His work was later used, without his direct involvement, to develop Zyklon B, used for the extermination of more than 1 million Jews in gas chambers in the greater context of the Holocaust.
After the Nazi rise to power in 1933, Haber was forced to resign from his positions because he was Jewish. Already in poor health, he spent time in various countries, before Chaim Weizmann invited him to become the director of the Sieff Research Institute (now the Weizmann Institute) in Rehovot, Mandatory Palestine. He accepted the offer, but died of heart failure mid-journey in a Basel hotel on 29 January 1934, aged 65.

He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the ""profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful"" poetry of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his ""elegant prose and magical poetry"" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as ""the Bard of Bengal"", Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, Biswokobi.A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha (""Sun Lion""), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in his founding of Visva-Bharati University.Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's ""Jana Gana Mana"" and Bangladesh's ""Amar Shonar Bangla"".

In both positions as well as a long legal career, he pioneered the American practice of international law. Root is sometimes considered the prototype of the 20th century political ""wise man,"" advising presidents on a range of foreign and domestic issues. He also served as a United States Senator from New York and received the 1912 Nobel Peace Prize.
Root was a leading New York City lawyer who moved frequently between high-level appointed government positions in Washington, D.C., and private-sector legal practice in New York City. His private clients included major corporations and such powerful players as Andrew Carnegie. Root served as president or chairman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Root was a prominent opponent of women's suffrage and worked to ensure the New York state constitution allowed only men to vote.
As Secretary of War from 1899 to 1904, Root administered colonial possessions won in the Spanish–American War, especially the Philippines and Cuba. Root favored a paternalistic approach to colonial administration, emphasizing technology, engineering, and disinterested public service. He helped design the Foraker Act of 1900, the Philippine Organic Act (1902), and the Platt Amendment of 1901. He was a strong advocate for the Panama Canal and the Open Door Policy. Root also modernized the Army into a professional military apparatus comparable to the best in Europe. He restructured the National Guard into an effective reserve, created the United States Army War College and established a general staff.
After a brief return to private life, Root rejoined the Roosevelt administration as Secretary of State from 1905 to 1909. Root modernized the consular service by minimizing patronage, promoted friendly relations with Latin America, and resolved frictions with Japan over the immigration of unskilled workers to the West Coast of the United States. He negotiated 24 bilateral international arbitration treaties, which led to the creation of the Permanent Court of International Justice.In the United States Senate, Root was a conservative supporter of President William Howard Taft. He played a central role in Taft's nomination to a second term at the 1912 Republican National Convention. By 1916, he was a leading proponent of military preparedness with the expectation that the United States would enter World War I. President Woodrow Wilson sent him to Russia in 1917 in an unsuccessful effort to establish an alliance with the new revolutionary government that had replaced the Czar.

928,Johannes Diderik van der Waals,The Nobel Prize in Physics,1910,1837,the Netherlands,1923, 1/1 ,"Amsterdam University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands ", “for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids” ,,,,,"Johannes Diderik van der Waals (Dutch pronunciation: [joːˈɦɑnəz ˈdidərɪk fɑn dər ˈʋaːls] (listen); 23 November 1837 – 8 March 1923) was a Dutch theoretical physicist and thermodynamicist famous for his pioneering work on the equation of state for gases and liquids. Van der Waals started his career as a schoolteacher. He became the first physics professor of the University of Amsterdam when in 1877 the old Athenaeum was upgraded to Municipal University. Van der Waals won the 1910 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids.His name is primarily associated with the Van der Waals equation of state that describes the behavior of gases and their condensation to the liquid phase. His name is also associated with Van der Waals forces (forces between stable molecules), with Van der Waals molecules (small molecular clusters bound by Van der Waals forces), and with Van der Waals radii (sizes of molecules). As James Clerk Maxwell said, ""there can be no doubt that the name of Van der Waals will soon be among the foremost in molecular science.""In his 1873 thesis, Van der Waals noted the non-ideality of real gases and attributed it to the existence of intermolecular interactions. He introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules. Spearheaded by Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald, a strong philosophical current that denied the existence of molecules arose towards the end of the 19th century. The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time Van der Waals's thesis was written (1873), the molecular structure of fluids had not been accepted by most physicists, and liquid and vapor were often considered as chemically distinct. But Van der Waals's work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and attractive strength. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state. By comparing his equation of state with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of their mutual attraction.The effect of Van der Waals's work on molecular physics in the 20th century was direct and fundamental. By introducing parameters characterizing molecular size and attraction in constructing his equation of state, Van der Waals set the tone for modern molecular science. That molecular aspects such as size, shape, attraction, and multipolar interactions should form the basis for mathematical formulations of the thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids is presently considered an axiom. With the help of the Van der Waals's equation of state, the critical-point parameters of gases could be accurately predicted from thermodynamic measurements made at much higher temperatures. Nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and helium subsequently succumbed to liquefaction. Heike Kamerlingh Onnes was significantly influenced by the pioneering work of Van der Waals.

Kossel isolated and described the five organic compounds that are present in nucleic acid: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. These compounds were later shown to be nucleobases, and are key in the formation of DNA and RNA, the genetic material found in all living cells.
Kossel was an important influence on and collaborator with other important researchers in biochemistry, including Henry Drysdale Dakin, Friedrich Miescher, Edwin B. Hart, and his professor and mentor, Felix Hoppe-Seyler. Kossel was editor of the Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) from 1895 until his death.

941,Ernest Rutherford,The Nobel Prize in Chemistry,1908,1871,New Zealand,1937, 1/1 ,"Victoria University, Manchester, United Kingdom "," “for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances” ",,,,,"Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson,  (30 August 1871 – 19 October 1937) was a New Zealand physicist who was a pioneering researcher in both atomic and nuclear physics. Rutherford has been described as ""the father of nuclear physics"", and the greatest experimentalist ""since Michael Faraday"". In 1908, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry ""for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances."" He was the first Oceanian Nobel laureate, and the first to perform the awarded work in Canada.
Rutherford's discoveries include the concept of radioactive half-life, the radioactive element radon, and the differentiation and naming of alpha and beta radiation. Together with Thomas Royds, Rutherford is credited with proving that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. In 1911, he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. He performed the first artificially induced nuclear reaction in 1917 in experiments where nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles. As a result, he discovered the emission of a subatomic particle which he initially called the ""hydrogen atom,"" but later (more accurately) named the proton. Later, Rutherford capped off his exploration of the nucleus with the discovery of the neutron. He is also credited with developing the atomic numbering system alongside Henry Moseley. His other achievements include advances in radio communications and ultrasound technology.
Rutherford became Director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1919. Under his leadership, the neutron was discovered by James Chadwick in 1932. In the same year, the first experiment to split the nucleus in a fully controlled manner was performed by students working under his direction, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton.

942,Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov,The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,1908,1845,Ukraine),1916, 1/2 ,"Institut Pasteur, Paris, France ", “in recognition of their work on immunity” ,,,,,"Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (Russian: Илья Ильич Мечников; 15 May [O.S. 3 May] 1845 – 15 July 1916), also spelled Élie Metchnikoff, was a Russian zoologist of Romanian noble ancestry best known for his pioneering research in immunology. He and Paul Ehrlich were jointly awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""in recognition of their work on immunity"".Mechnikov was born in a region of the Russian Empire that is today part of the modern-day Ukraine to a Romanian noble father and a Ukrainian-Jewish mother, and later on continued his career in France. Given this complex heritage, five different nations and peoples lay claim to Metchnikoff. Despite having a mother of Jewish origin, he was baptized Russian Orthodox, although he later became an atheist.
Honoured as the ""father of innate immunity"", Metchnikoff was the first to discover a process of immunity called phagocytosis and the cell responsible for it, called phagocyte, specifically macrophage, in 1882. This discovery turned out to be the major defence mechanism in innate immunity, as well as the foundation of the concept of cell-mediated immunity, while Ehrlich established the concept of humoral immunity to complete the principles of immune system. Their works are regarded as the foundation of the science of immunology.Metchnikoff developed one of the earliest concepts in ageing, and advocated the use of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus) for healthy and long life. This became the concept of probiotics in medicine. Mechnikov is also credited with coining the term gerontology in 1903, for the emerging study of aging and longevity. In this regard, Ilya Mechnikov is called the ""father of gerontology"" (although, as often happens in science, the situation is ambiguous, and the same title is sometimes applied to some other people who contributed to aging research later).

Among his foremost achievements were finding a cure for syphilis in 1909 and inventing the precursor technique to Gram staining bacteria. The methods he developed for staining tissue made it possible to distinguish between different types of blood cells, which led to the ability to diagnose numerous blood diseases.
His laboratory discovered arsphenamine (Salvarsan), the first effective medicinal treatment for syphilis, thereby initiating and also naming the concept of chemotherapy. Ehrlich popularized the concept of a magic bullet. He also made a decisive contribution to the development of an antiserum to combat diphtheria and conceived a method for standardizing therapeutic serums.In 1908, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to immunology.

He was born in British India, which inspired much of his work.
Kipling's works of fiction include the Jungle Book duology (The Jungle Book, 1894; The Second Jungle Book, 1895), Kim (1901), the Just So Stories (1902) and many short stories, including ""The Man Who Would Be King"" (1888). His poems include ""Mandalay"" (1890), ""Gunga Din"" (1890), ""The Gods of the Copybook Headings"" (1919), ""The White Man's Burden"" (1899), and ""If—"" (1910). He is seen as an innovator in the art of the short story. His children's books are classics; one critic noted ""a versatile and luminous narrative gift"".Kipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdom's most popular writers. Henry James said ""Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius, as distinct from fine intelligence, that I have ever known."" In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, as the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and at 41, its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood, but declined both. Following his death in 1936, his ashes were interred at Poets' Corner, part of the South Transept of Westminster Abbey.
Kipling's subsequent reputation has changed with the political and social climate of the age. The contrasting views of him continued for much of the 20th century. Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote: ""[Kipling] is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced.

Thomson is also credited with finding the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions). His experiments to determine the nature of positively charged particles, with Francis William Aston, were the first use of mass spectrometry and led to the development of the mass spectrograph.Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases.

He was the eldest son of President Theodore Roosevelt and First Lady Edith Roosevelt. Roosevelt is known for his World War II service, including the directing of troops at Utah Beach during the Normandy landings, for which he received the Medal of Honor.
Roosevelt was educated at private academies and Harvard University; after his 1909 graduation from college, he began a successful career in business and investment banking.  Having gained pre-World War I army experience during his attendance at a Citizens' Military Training Camp, at the start of the war he received a reserve commission as a major. He served primarily with the 1st Division, took part in several engagements including the Battle of Cantigny, and commanded the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry as a lieutenant colonel. After the war, Roosevelt was instrumental in the forming of The American Legion.
In addition to his military and business careers, Roosevelt was active in politics and government. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy (1921–1924), Governor of Puerto Rico (1929–1932), and Governor-General of the Philippines (1932–1933). He resumed his business endeavors in the 1930s, and was Chairman of the Board of American Express Company, and vice-president of Doubleday Books. Roosevelt also remained active as an Army reservist, attending annual training periods at Pine Camp, and completing the Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced Courses, the Command and General Staff College, and refresher training for senior officers. He returned to active duty for World War II with the rank of colonel, and commanded the 26th Infantry.  He soon received promotion to brigadier general as assistant division commander of the 1st Infantry Division.
After serving in the Operation Torch landings in North Africa and the Tunisia Campaign, followed by participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily, Roosevelt was assigned as assistant division commander of the 4th Infantry Division. In this role, he led the first wave of troops ashore at Utah Beach during the Normandy landings in June 1944. He died in France of a heart attack the following month; at the time of his death, he had been recommended for the Distinguished Service Cross to recognize his heroism at Normandy.

As the discoverer of the specific causative agents of deadly infectious diseases including tuberculosis, cholera (though the bacterium itself was discovered by Filippo Pacini in 1854), and anthrax, he is regarded as one of the main founders of modern bacteriology. As such he is popularly nicknamed the father of microbiology (with Louis Pasteur), and as the father of medical bacteriology. His discovery of the anthrax bacterium (Bacillus anthracis) in 1876 is considered as the birth of modern bacteriology. His discoveries directly provided proofs for the germ theory of diseases, and the scientific basis of public health.While working as a private physician, Koch developed many innovative techniques in microbiology. He was the first to use the oil immersion lens, condenser, and microphotography in microscopy. His invention of the bacterial culture method using agar and glass plates (later developed as the Petri dish by his assistant Julius Richard Petri) made him the first to grow bacteria in the laboratory. In appreciation of his work, he was appointed to government advisor at the Imperial Health Office in 1880, promoted to a senior executive position (Geheimer Regierungsrat) in 1882, Director of Hygienic Institute and Chair (Professor of hygiene) of the Faculty of Medicine at Berlin University in 1885, and the Royal Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases (later renamed Robert Koch Institute after his death) in 1891.
The methods Koch used in bacteriology led to establishment of a medical concept known as Koch's postulates, four generalized medical principles to ascertain the relationship of pathogens with specific diseases. The concept is still in use in most situations and influences subsequent epidemiological principles such as the Bradford Hill criteria. A major controversy followed when Koch discovered tuberculin as a medication for tuberculosis which was proven to be ineffective, but developed for diagnosis of tuberculosis after his death.

He is best remembered for his historical novels, such as the Trilogy series and especially for his internationally known best-seller Quo Vadis (1896).
Born into an impoverished Polish noble family in Russian-ruled Congress Poland, in the late 1860s he began publishing journalistic and literary pieces. In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States, sending back travel essays that won him popularity with Polish readers. In the 1880s he began serializing novels that further increased his popularity.  He soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous translations gained him international renown, culminating in his receipt of the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature for his ""outstanding merits as an epic writer.""
Many of his novels remain in print. In Poland he is best known for his ""Trilogy"" of historical novels – With Fire and Sword, The Deluge, and Sir Michael – set in the 17th-century Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth; internationally he is best known for Quo Vadis, set in Nero's Rome.

988,Jean Henry Dunant,The Nobel Peace Prize,1901,1828,Switzerland,1910, 1/2 ,, “for his humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding” ,,,,,"Henry Dunant (born Jean-Henri Dunant; 8 May 1828 – 30 October 1910), also known as Henri Dunant, was a Swiss humanitarian, businessman, social activist and the co-founder of Red Cross movement. His humanitarian efforts won him the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901.
Dunant was born in Geneva to a devout Calvinist family and had business interests in French Algeria and Tunisia. In 1859, while on his way to petition Napoleon III, he witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino in northern Italy. Horrified by the suffering of the wounded and the lack of care they received, Dunant took the initiative to organize the local population in providing aid for the soldiers. After returning to Geneva, he recorded his experiences in the book A Memory of Solferino, in which he advocated the formation of an organization that would provide relief for the wounded without discrimination in times of war. In February 1863, Dunant was a member of a five-person committee that sought to put his plan into action, which in effect founded the organization that would become the International Committee of the Red Cross. A year later, he took part in a diplomatic conference organized by the Swiss government that led to the signing of the First Geneva Convention.
Dunant became embroiled in a business scandal in 1867 which resulted in his bankruptcy and expulsion from the International Committee. He spent the next decades in poverty and obscurity, living in various places across Europe before settling in the Swiss village of Heiden. In 1895, Dunant was rediscovered by a journalist, which brought him renewed attention and support, and in 1901 he was awarded the first Nobel Peace Prize alongside French pacifist Frédéric Passy.

989,Frédéric Passy,The Nobel Peace Prize,1901,1822,France,1912, 1/2 ,," “for his lifelong work for international peace conferences, diplomacy and arbitration” ",,,,,"Frédéric Passy (20 May 1822 – 12 June 1912) was a French economist and pacifist who was a founding member of several peace societies and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He was also an author and politician, sitting in the Chamber of Deputies from 1881 until 1889. He was a joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 for his work in the European peace movement.
Born in Paris to a prominent Catholic and Orléanist family, Passy was surrounded by military veterans and politicians. After training in law, he worked as an accountant and served in the National Guard. He soon left this position and began travelling around France giving lectures on economics. Following years of violent conflicts across Europe, Passy joined the peace movement in the 1850s, working with several notable activists and writers to develop journals, articles, and educational curricula.
While sitting in the Chamber of Deputies, Passy developed the Inter-parliamentary Conference (later the Inter-Parliamentary Union) with British MP William Randal Cremer. Alongside this, he founded several peace societies: the Ligue Internationale et Permanente de la Paix, the Société Française des Amis de la Paix, and the Société Française pour l'Arbitrage entre Nations. Passy's work in the peace movement continued into his later years, and in 1901, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Red Cross founder, Henry Dunant.
Passy died in 1912 after a long period of illness and incapacitation. Despite his economic works gaining little traction, his efforts in the peace movement resulted in him being recognised as the ""dean of European peace activists"".: 34  His son, Paul Passy, published a memoir of his life in 1927, and his works are still being republished and translated into English in the 21st Century.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Passy,68,"['1822 births', '1912 deaths', 'Articles containing French-language text', 'Articles containing Latin-language text', 'Articles with BIBSYS identifiers', 'Articles with BNC identifiers', 'Articles with BNF identifiers', 'Articles with BNFdata identifiers', 'Articles with CINII identifiers', 'Articles with DTBIO identifiers', 'Articles with FAST identifiers', 'Articles with GND identifiers', 'Articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Articles with J9U identifiers', 'Articles with KBR identifiers', 'Articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Articles with NKC identifiers', 'Articles with NLG identifiers', 'Articles with NSK identifiers', 'Articles with NTA identifiers', 'Articles with PLWABN identifiers', 'Articles with PortugalA identifiers', 'Articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Articles with Sycomore identifiers', 'Articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1', 'Commanders of the Legion of Honour', 'French Christian pacifists', 'French Nobel laureates', 'French economists', 'Good articles', 'Inter-Parliamentary Union', 'Members of the 3rd Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic', 'Members of the 4th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic', 'Members of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques', 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates', 'Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024', 'Non-interventionism', 'Opportunist Republicans', 'Passy family', 'Politicians from Paris', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Use dmy dates from June 2020']",45,5
